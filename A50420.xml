            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the following deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Moffet-wells</hi> may be the better underſtood, we thought it neceſſary to premiſe ſome things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>elements</hi> of <hi>Chymie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are ſix ſimple (though Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, of the four <hi>elements</hi> compoſed) bodies, whereof every <hi>Animal, Vegetable</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> body is compoſed, and into which they are reſolved, by deſtillation and calcination; and they are theſe. 1. <hi>Earth.</hi> 2. <hi>Phlegme,</hi> or the <hi>inſipide Liquor.</hi> 3. <hi>Mercury,</hi> or the <hi>acide Spirit.</hi> 4. <hi>Sulphur,</hi> or the <hi>combuſtible Liquor.</hi> 5. <hi>Volatile-ſalt,</hi> which cannot endure the fire, but flyeth from it. 6. <hi>Fixed-ſalt,</hi> which reſiſteth the ſtrongeſt of <hi>Vulcan's</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59896:10"/>fury (his vitrifying heat only excepted) without any damage. The laſt four only are called <hi>Elements</hi> (by way of excellency above the reſt) becauſe they only are endued with medicinal virtues.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The foreſaid bodies are called <hi>ſimple;</hi> becauſe they connot be reſolved into heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal parts, by deſtillation, without the adding of a heterogeneal body.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Mercury, Sulphur, Salt-volatile</hi> and <hi>Fixed-ſalt,</hi> are called the <hi>elements</hi> of all the foreſaid Bodies, becauſe they are compoſed of them; but not becauſe all of them can be extracted out of any body, and made obvious to the ſenſes: for, there can but a little <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile-ſalt</hi> be extracted out of ſome things, and very little <hi>Fixed-ſalt</hi> out of others. In the Original we aſſerted, that <hi>there can no Volatile-ſalt be extracted out of man's Blood:</hi> but having ſince attained a more exact manner of deſtilling the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> and ſeparated ſome <hi>Volatile-ſalt</hi> (which attacheth it ſelf to the ſides of the recipient, like Spiders webs) from them, we do retract that aſſertion; having in the Epiſtle to the Reader profeſſed, <hi>that we did not live, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the confines of humane fallibility.</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:59896:10"/>But it is ordinarly, in greater abundance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of the <hi>hornes, feathers, &amp;c.</hi> of living Creatures. Likewiſe, there can be but very little <hi>Fixed-ſalt</hi> extracted out of theſe, unleſs they be taken in great quantities, and put to a tryal: for, where the <hi>Volatile-ſalt</hi> doth abound, there is little of the <hi>Fixed-ſalt,</hi> and contrarywiſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Earth</hi> (which they call <hi>the dead head</hi>) is, as it were, the ſubject of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Elements, and is of no uſe or virtue, when the Elements are ſeparated from it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Phlegme</hi> is only the carrier of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to the Elements. As for example, <hi>water</hi> is only the carrier of that aliment, which <hi>Vegetables</hi> and <hi>Minerals</hi> do ſuck out of the <hi>Earth</hi> for their nutrition; and it is the carrier alſo of that nouriſhment, which living Creatures do extract out of the parts of <hi>Vegetables</hi> and <hi>Minerals,</hi> as the <hi>Phlegme</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> is, only the carrier (or chariot) of thoſe active Spirits, which do exhilerate the heart of man.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is not only certain, from the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi> reſolution of bodies, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Elements have a real exiſtence in <hi>nature,</hi> but it is alſo naturally known to all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59896:11"/>
                     <hi>Cooks;</hi> for in their dreſsing of Meats, they labour to ſupply the penury of <hi>Sulphur, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> by adding <hi>Butter, Vinegar</hi> and <hi>Common-ſalt,</hi> in making of Sauces.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In the reſolution of any natural Body (that is in a natural eſtate) by deſtilling, the <hi>Phlegme</hi> exſtilleth firſt; 2. the <hi>Mercury;</hi> 3. <hi>Sulphur;</hi> 4. <hi>Salt-volatile;</hi> and, 5. the <hi>Fixed-ſalt</hi> remaineth in the earthly part, from which it is to be extracted by calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſolution, filtration and coagulation. Neither doth this falſifie what hath been ſaid, that in the deſtilling of fermented <hi>Wine</hi> (that is, which hath ſtood one, two, or moe dayes, after i'ts being preſſed out of the Grapes) the ſulphureous Spirit exſtilleth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt: for this cometh to paſs, becauſe the ſulphureous Spirit (which is Volatile of it ſelf) is ſeparated from the reſt of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by fermentation, and is in an unnatural eſtate. Neither doth any more of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit exſtill, then is ſeparated from the Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by fermentation. And in the deſtilling of new <hi>Wine,</hi> the ſulphureous Spirit beginneth to exſtill, before that the Phlegme is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeparated; becauſe of the ſuddain fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the <hi>Wine,</hi> which cauſeth the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59896:11"/>ſulphureous and volatile ſpirit reject that bond and tye, under which it was formerly: For all bodies, when they are in their natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, are alwaies reſolved by art, after one and the ſame manner: that is to ſay, their elements are ſtill ſeparated in the ſame order. So that it is probable, that in the deſtilling of not-fermented <hi>Wine,</hi> the <hi>Vinegar</hi> or mercurial-part (which is the true <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>Wine:</hi> For ſpirit is firſt, and moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, attributed to <hi>Mercury,</hi> and in the next place only to <hi>Sulphur</hi>) would exſtill before the ſulphureous ſpirit, if the fermentation of <hi>Wine</hi> could be impeded whil'ſt it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling.</p>
                  <p>You would here take notice of the reaſon, why the ſimple <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> doth paſs ſooner and more facilely through the ſtomach, and occaſion leſs unpleaſant eructations from it, than when it is impregnat with the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous ſpirits of <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> or other Spices. We conceive that this cometh to paſs, becauſe the ſpirit of Wine is a moſt homogencal body, which debateth leſs with the natural heat and flatulent vapors, which are contained in the ſlomach, than when it is aſſociat to the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous ſpirits of Spices: for the more ſorts
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59896:12"/>there be of them, there is the greater confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and debate amongſt them, and betwixt them and the forementioned flatulent vapors, when they begin to be altered and concocted by the natural heat; and therefore the eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations occaſioned by this ſtrife, cannot but be more frequent and noyſom to the pallat, than ſuch as proceed from a leſs confuſed and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent debate.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The <hi>Mercury,</hi> or acide Spirit, is the <hi>ferment</hi> of the forementioned bodies.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Ferment</hi> in general, is either <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>artificial;</hi> and each of theſe, is either <hi>ſimple</hi> or <hi>compoſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>ſimple ferment,</hi> is the proper <hi>mercury</hi> of any ſimple body (as of <hi>Wine, Milk,</hi> &amp;c.) which being incited by external heat, doth produce a ſwelling of the body (whoſe it is) and a ſeparation of its he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneal parts or elements, as the <hi>mercury</hi> or <hi>vinegar</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> cauſeth it to ſwell, and produceth a ſeparation of the <hi>ſulphur</hi> from it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as alſo of the <hi>ſalt</hi> (contained in the <hi>tartar,</hi> which doth attach it ſelf to the ſides of the veſſel) from both.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>compoſed ferment,</hi> is made up of the praper <hi>mercuries</hi> of ſeveral
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59896:12"/>ſimple bodies (as of <hi>Cinnamon, Opium,</hi> &amp;c. whereof <hi>Treacle</hi> is compoſed) and produceth a ſwelling of it, and a conjunction of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral elements and qualities (of the many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent bodies) as it were, into one new nature; and that by fermentation, concerning which you ſhall have more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Here you may obſerve, that a ſimple body, which hath been fermented, by its <hi>ſimple</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>mercury,</hi> may be thus alſo, as it were, fermented. As, well fermented <hi>Wine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put into a glaſs (hermetically ſealed, or well ſtopped with a <hi>Cork</hi>) and expoſed to the <hi>Sun</hi> his beams, in the <hi>Canicular-dayes,</hi> its <hi>mercury</hi> or fixed ſpirit, will alter the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous and <hi>volatile ſpirit,</hi> and change it into its proper nature, by fixing it; and the ſulphureous and <hi>volatile ſpirit,</hi> will in ſome meaſure volatiliſe the <hi>fixed ſpirit:</hi> for <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar</hi> thus prepared, is the beſt and ſtrongeſt. And hence it appeareth, that the ſpirit which doth firſt exſtill, in the abſtraction of ſuch Vinegar from Mettals, which have been diſſolved by it (and which is commonly called <hi>the burning ſpirit of the mettal,</hi> and <hi>by Angelus Sala</hi> in his ſeventh <hi>Aphoriſme of the firſt Sect, a part of the Vinegar conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59896:13"/>into a burning ſpirit, like to the ſpirit of Wine, and the very ſpirit of Vinegar</hi>) is not ſo much the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> as either a part of the ſulphureous and <hi>volatile ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>Wine,</hi> which revivifieth, as it were, by defermentation (if we may thus ſpeak) for it was fixed by the fixed ſpirit of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and is now for ſaken, when it beginneth to operat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mettal which it diſſolveth; or that part of the ſulphureous ſpirit, which the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial had not fixed compleatly. The verity of this is proven by another operation like unto it, <hi>viz.</hi> in the deſtilling of the <hi>Butter of Antimony</hi> out of equal parts of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:</hi> and <hi>Corroſive-ſublimed-Mercury,</hi> the ſalinous ſpirit of the <hi>ſublimat,</hi> which had before corroded, and united to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the <hi>Mercury,</hi> when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by a new heat, they begin to corrod the <hi>Antimony,</hi> and do forſake the <hi>Mercury,</hi> which they did formerly corrod: for when the fire is augmented, the revivified <hi>Mercury</hi> exſtilleth towards the end of the deſtillation. Yea, the <hi>Butter of Antimony,</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>ſalts</hi> of the <hi>ſublimat,</hi> by corroſion impregnat with the <hi>Reguleal</hi> part of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> For we did convert the <hi>Emetick
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59896:13"/>powder</hi> (which is made of the <hi>Butter of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi>) into the <hi>Regulus of Antimony;</hi> and in this operation we perceived no ſign of the revivifying of any parts of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was done by the great violence of fire.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>artificial</hi> and <hi>ſimple ferment,</hi> is the proper and <hi>natural ferment</hi> of any ſimple body, which produceth a fermentation, in any ſimple or compoſed body, to which it is artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially applied. As when the <hi>juyce of a Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Wine,</hi> or the <hi>proper Mercury</hi> of the ſtomach of a beaſt do produce the fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Milk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>artificial</hi> and <hi>compoſed ferment,</hi> is a ferment made of many others, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Earning</hi> (which is made of the ſtomach of a beaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) by which <hi>Milk</hi> is ordinarily fermented, or curded.</p>
                  <p>Here obſerve, 1. that the <hi>natural ferment</hi> doth ſometimes produce a more exact fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, than the <hi>artificial.</hi> As when the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ferment of <hi>Milk</hi> doth produce a more exact ſeparation of the ſulphur from the reſt (when it cauſeth it paſs to the ſuperior part in the <hi>Cream,</hi> although that ſeparation muſt be afterwards perfected by motion, in reducing it to <hi>Butter</hi>) than the artificial ferment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59896:14"/>ſimple (as the <hi>juyce of a Lemmon</hi>) or compoſed (as the common <hi>Earning</hi> or <hi>Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>) which do not ſo exactly ſeparat the Butter from the earthy part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which the Cheeſe is compoſed. for both the Cheeſe and the Whey are moſt capable of further fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby their heterogeneal parts will be exactly ſeparated from each other. 2. It is the <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is excited by external heat, that produceth the fermentation of a body, as doth appear in <hi>Milk,</hi> which being ſufficiently fermented (that is, whoſe ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſufficiently ſeparated from each other) contracteth a ſharp and mercurial taſte which is gradually augmented, according to the different hours and dayes of its fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is known to every Ruſtick, that maketh <hi>Butter.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Ale</hi> (which is ſweet before that it be fermented) doth contract the very like taſte (which doth reſide into the <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> excited by external heat, and permeating all the liquor, and fixing ſome of the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous parts; for a great external cold will impede the fermentation or working of <hi>Ale</hi>) when it is fermented. To theſe you may add, that the <hi>Bilious humour</hi> contained in the body of a living creature, is in two reſpects,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59896:14"/>as it were, a <hi>ferment.</hi> 1. In reſpect of the <hi>Chyle,</hi> it is a natural and ſimple ferment (for it is generated of the natural and proper ferments of meat and drink) which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a ſeparation of it ſelf from the <hi>blood, Melancholick humour</hi> and <hi>Phlegme,</hi> and of theſe from each other, by fermentation. And in this reſolution of <hi>Chyle, Blood</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to <hi>Sulphur, Choler</hi> or the bilious humour to <hi>Mercury, Urine</hi> (though impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat with ſome <hi>Volatile</hi> and <hi>Fixed-ſalts</hi>) to <hi>Phlegme,</hi> and <hi>Melancholy</hi> to the <hi>Fixed-ſalt</hi> contained in the earthy part. 2. In reſpect of the whole body: for it is commonly (yet deſervedly) called a <hi>natural Clyſter,</hi> which doth irritat the expultrix faculty of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines</hi> (into which it daily ſloweth, out of its natural receptacle, the <hi>Gall</hi>) for the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, and ſeparation of, the excrements.</p>
                  <p>From the premiſſes, you may collect the manner how ſome purgatives do open the belly. For when purgatives are put into the ſtomach (as into a <hi>Retort</hi> which hath a ſtroup ariſing from its upper part, ſerving for the re-affuſion of that liquor, which did once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill by the other, that it may be re-deſtilled: For the <hi>Wezand</hi> or <hi>Oeſophage</hi> anſwereth to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59896:15"/>that ſtroup in the <hi>Retort</hi>) they are altered by its heat, and by the heat of the circum-jacent parts, and their proper Mercuries, which do exſtill by the nether orifice of the ſtomach, called the <hi>Pylorus</hi> which anſwereth to the common ſtroup of the <hi>Retort</hi>) do produce a commotion and fermentation of the humours in the Inteſtines, and thereafter (in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of this deſtillation-like operation) the Sulphur and Volatile-ſalt being commoved and exſtilled, they do (by a certain occult qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which is only known to God the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and to which the creatures of this <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing-God</hi> muſt have their recourſe, ſeing that we know only in part) excite and irritat the expultrix faculty to expell; and when the ſtrength of the purging Medicine, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionat to the ſtrength of the body, the bad humours only (which are onerous and moſt hurtfull to nature) are purged forth. For then nature retaineth the good and uſefull humours, although they be commoved with the reſt. But if the Medicine be in its ſtrength diſproportionat to the conſtitution and ſtrength of the body, then the good, as well as the bad, are promiſcuouſly purged forth, and that painfully: Becauſe that ſuch
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59896:15"/>things only as ſhould, are not excerned, as ſaid <hi>Hippoc.</hi> lib. 1. Aphor. 2. I ſaid, 1. that <hi>the occult quality of the Sulphur and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile-ſalt, did irritate the expultrix faculty:</hi> the firſt Liquor only wherein <hi>Rubarb</hi> hath been infuſed, doth purge by irritating the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultrix faculty; becauſe the Sulphur and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile-ſalt are diſſolved in it. 2. That <hi>this irritation of the expultrix faculty, ought to be aſcribed unto an occult quality</hi> (ſeing the Sulphur and Volatile-ſalt of <hi>Lamer,</hi> are neither purgative nor vomitive) becauſe the Sulphur and Volatile-ſalt of <hi>Rubarb</hi> are ſimple Bodies, which cannot be (by <hi>Art</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into heterogeneal parts, that the cauſes of theſe effects which they produce, might be known.</p>
                  <p>But when a Medicine made of <hi>Antimony,</hi> or ſuch-like, is exhibited, vomiting proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth purging by ſtool; becauſe the abounding humors in the Stomach, which are volatile, (not that they contain Volatile-ſalt, but only becauſe bilious for the moſt part, which do occaſion a nauſeating, by their ſpontaneous tending upwards, as a bird in flying) are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly commoved by the Sulphur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>Antimony,</hi> &amp;c. And not finding, a facile
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59896:16"/>egreſs by the neather Orifice, they are, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, forced upwards.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add this aſſertion to what hath been ſaid, and endeavour to render it's verity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of fermentation is the great <hi>key of Nature,</hi> which the <hi>Former of all things,</hi> hath put into the hands of <hi>man,</hi> for the unlocking of her ſecret <hi>Cabins,</hi> that he might the more clearly behold her greateſt myſteries.</p>
                  <p>The truth of this will become unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, if you will but conſider, 1. that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is greatly inabled, to reſolve the Bodies of Animals and Vegetables: for ſuch are beſt reſolved, when fermentation is premitted, As when fermented Barley affoardeth a moſt ſubtile, active, and ardent ſulphureous Spirit, which it would exhibit under a groſſer and oleaginous form, if it ſhould be deſtilled, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a previous fermentation. And <hi>Milk</hi> is better reſolved into <hi>Wig,</hi> (which, by deſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, may be converted into an inſipid Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a Mercurial Spirit) <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Curds</hi> by fermentation in a <hi>Churn,</hi> then into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by deſtillation: becauſe of the <hi>empyreuma</hi> accompanying them:</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59896:16"/>2. The knowledge of fermentation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth the reaſon, why all meats, (whether they be made of Animals or Vegetables) which are fermented, are more eaſily digeſted and do nouriſh better, than ſuch as are not fermented. As for example, fermented <hi>Bread</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is more caſtly digeſted and yieldeth better nouriſhment, than any other doth; becauſe it's ſulphureous part is ſubtilized and looſed by fermentation, which maketh it to be the more eaſily and quickly ſeparated from the Bread, whil'ſt it is a concocting in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. And (for the ſame reaſon) the fleſhes of all ſorts of Animals are fitteſt for being eaten, the ſecond or third day after their mactation, as the practice of all doth prove. Moreover, do we not delay the drinking of <hi>Wine, Sider, Ale, Beer,</hi> &amp;c. untill they be fermented? for then they do nouriſh moſt, and are of a moſt facile digeſtion, becauſe their alimentary parts (eſpecially the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur) are, by fermentation, looſed from the terreſtrial and groſs ſubject, wherein they did formerly reſide, and are ſubtilized and evect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a more ſubtile and ſpirituous conſiſtence, which rendereth them more plyable to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the natural heat; and are not theſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59896:17"/>ſubtilized alimentary parts, the thing which doth inebriat a weak Brain, for a little time held over the Veſſel wherein <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Ale,</hi> &amp;c. are fermenting. It is, certainly, undenyable; becauſe, if <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Ale</hi> were put into a Still (artificially adjuſted) when the fermentation begins to appear, you ſhould (without the aſsiſtance of <hi>Vulcan</hi>) at the end, find ſome of thoſe ſubtile Spirits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into an ardent Liquor in the receiver.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Medico-Philoſophical diſcourſes</hi> of Dr. <hi>Thomas Willes,</hi> (a Phyſician at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the perfection of whoſe Learning, my quill is not able to deſcribe) you will find many things concerning fermentation which were never heard of before, and which are (for the moſt part) conſonant to what is here; all which were but lately publiſhed in Latine and came to our hands, two moneths after theſe, and what followeth, were written. And in them is the nature of fermentation more exactly deſcribed then ever.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The differences of <hi>Colours</hi> do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the different degrees of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Sulphur; as the colours of <hi>Red-roſes, Gillofers, Violets,</hi> &amp;c. do (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt) proceed from th Sulphur which is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59896:17"/>concocted, untill it contract a red, blew, or the like colour, whereof it was deſtitute, when impregnat only with viridity in the juyces which nouriſhed the Flowers. For, when the <hi>Salt</hi> of a Vegetable, containing perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted Sulphur, (as of <hi>Worm-wood, Fincle,</hi> the <hi>Vine,</hi> &amp;c.) is mixed with the <hi>tinctures</hi> of thoſe Flowers, they do preſently contract a green colour; becauſe the <hi>Salt</hi> produceth an indigeſtion and recrudeſcence of the <hi>Sulphur.</hi> For, the firſt colour of any Vegetable is <hi>green,</hi> which proceedeth from the crudity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect digeſtion of the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh red or blew, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when it is further concocted by nature, as it happeneth in the fore-mentioned Flowers, and in the leaves of many Vegetables, as of <hi>Trees,</hi> &amp;c. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>yellow,</hi> &amp;c. when they attain unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. I ſaid, 1. <hi>The ſalt of a Vegetable;</hi> becauſe no <hi>Minerall-ſalt</hi> (as <hi>Nitre, Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi> &amp;c.) doth render the <hi>Vegetable Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> indigeſted. 2. <hi>The Salt of a Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, which containeth perfectly concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sulphur;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Scurvy-graſs</hi> (which is a Vegetable, not containing perfectly concocted Sulphur) or ſuch like, do not render the foreſaid Sulphur indigeſted.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59896:18"/>You may obſerve by the way, that the Spirits of <hi>Nitre, Common-ſalt, Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> do perfect the foreſaid tinctures which were made green, by re-inveſting them with their former colours; although the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> aſcending from it in ſmoak, when it is inflamed (for the foreſaid Spirit of <hi>Brimſtone</hi> is nothing elſe, but the ſmoak which aſcendeth from inflamed <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> and is afterwards condenſed into a Liquor, as you ſhall hear) doth albiſie a recent <hi>Red-Roſe;</hi> and the <hi>Oyl of Tartar</hi> will inveſt it with greenneſs, if it be a little broken and infuſed in the Oyl.

                  <p>We ſaid before, <hi>That the differences of Colours do proceed from the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the concoction of the Sulphur; or from the alterations produced in the Sulphur, by the actions of corroſive bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:</hi> the truth of which aſſertion we will further eſſay to demonſtrat, by ſhewing (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our own opinion) the manner how

                  <p>It is vulgarly aſſerted by <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> that excrementitious <hi>Bile</hi> is of four kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Bilis Vitellina,</hi> which is general of yellow <hi>Bile.</hi> 2. <hi>Porracea,</hi> which taketh it's origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the <hi>Vitelline.</hi> 3. <hi>Aeruginoſa,</hi> proceeding from the <hi>Porraceous.</hi> 4. <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtea,</hi> which oweth it's original to the <hi>Aerugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous;</hi> all which they affirm, <hi>Majori ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per aduſtione generari, &amp; plures caloris gradus acquirere.</hi> And concerning <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi> they write thus; <hi>Dum Melancholia excrementitia praeter naturam ſe habet, atra Bilis apellatur, quae ferventiſſima eſt, &amp; acerrima; &amp; ex Melancholia naturali, Bile flava, ſanguine, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <item>1. <hi>Salt,</hi> and all bodies wherein it doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domine, are cold and moiſt; as will afterward be proven by ſeveral arguments.</item>

                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59896:19"/>Theſe things being premiſed, we are of opinion, that <hi>Blood</hi> containeth <hi>Sulphur, Salt, Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. but more <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> or <hi>Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Spirit</hi> than <hi>Sulphur,</hi> when the <hi>Chyle</hi> is firſt converted into blood in the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, becauſe this <hi>Salinous</hi> Spirit is to ſerve for other uſes, than the alimenting of any part: for, in the ſecond concoction, it is the chief agent in producing the red colour of Blood, by it's action upon the Sulphur of the <hi>Chyle.</hi> Moreover, another part of it, by operating after another manner upon ſome other part of the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> produceth the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour in <hi>Bile;</hi> which being generat, is ſent to the <hi>Gall,</hi> that it's gradual emanation from thence, may (like a natural <hi>Clyſter</hi>) irritat the expultrix faculty of the Inteſtines.

                  </p>
                  <p>The truth of theſe things will eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to any who will be at the pains to obſerve

                  <p>Moreover, none will queſtion the truth of our former aſſertion, if they will but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that as of the juyce of <hi>Celledon</hi> (which is of the colour of <hi>Bilis vitellina</hi>) the green leaves of it are made, when it is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted by nature, and thereby it's Sulphur doth ſuffer a new alteration, by the action of it's acide ſpirit upon it, whereby the <hi>Vitelline</hi> (or yellow) colour in the juyce, is converted into a <hi>green</hi> in the leaves.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59896:20"/>Here we cannot but mention two conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things, and offer our opinion concerning their cauſes. The one is concerning ſome <hi>Vegetables</hi> in general, and the other concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Houſ-leek</hi> in particular.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, it is vulgarly known, that there are many <hi>Vegetables,</hi> (as the <hi>Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leek, Ivy,</hi> &amp;c.) whoſe leaves do not fade or wither in the <hi>Harveſt</hi> or <hi>Winter,</hi> but do remain as green and ſucculent then, as they were in the <hi>Summer.</hi> We conceive the cauſe of this perennal viridity is two-fold. 1. The imperfect concoction of their Sulphur, which (as you read a little before) perpetually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth viridity in Vegetables, and is not capable of evaporation (as is the Sulphur of other Vegetables when they come to maturity; that is, when their ſeeds are ripe) ſo long as the Vegetative life is not extinguiſhed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of it's more ſtrict union with their ſalts, which do detain it, and ſo prohibiteth it's avolation. 2. The ſalt of thoſe Herbs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more <hi>nitrous</hi> than the ſalt of other Herbs, it is more firmly united to the Sulphur, (which in ſuch, is ſtill more reſinous, as in the <hi>Fir-tree,</hi> &amp;c.) and therefore doth more ſtrongly detain, not only the Sulphur, but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59896:21"/>alſo the aqueous humidity from evaporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond, it is well known, that the <hi>Houſ-leek,</hi> being ſuſpended in the air with it's roots, doth not at firſt wither, as <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> &amp;c. but accreſs to a greater big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhooting forth new leaves and a ſtem. Before we offer our opinion concerning the reaſon of this, we will firſt acknowledge, that this accretion is not a proper growth, (as when the roots received aliment from the earth) becauſe, as one or two leaves do pullulat from the top, as many at the root fade and become dry. Theſe leaves therefore which do germi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat from it's centre, do not ſpring forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of any nouriſhment which the root doth receive from the ambient air; but, becauſe the juyce of the root and former leaves doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ede into new leaves and a ſtem: for they do wither more then if they had been ſeparated from one another, and dryed apart. But in progreſs of time, all the Herb fadeth and ceaſeth to germinat any more, by reaſon of the totall exhalation of the vegetative Spirits and their aliment, by inſenſible tranſpiration.

                  <p>Six years ago, a valetudenary Ruſtick (as I was credibly informed) who was accuſtomed to make an anniverſary it neration to the Wells at <hi>Bramt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> as he was travelling through <hi>Annandale,</hi> he felt a ſmell like to that of <hi>Brampton</hi> wells, which made him walk contrary to the wind, following the ſmell brought thereby; and then, upon the top of a little Rock (which nature hath ſcituated north-wards, and at the diſtance of one mile from <hi>Moffet</hi>) which was covered with mire and clay, he diſcovered two little Spring-wells, the neather
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59896:23"/>and biggeſt whereof, is diſtant from the ſteep Rock (by whoſe ſide runneth a little Burn, into which the Water deſcendeth) about two or three foot, and the upper about ſix or ſeven. When expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience had induced him to believe, that theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, were, in their qualities and operations, moſt like unto the Waters of <hi>Brampton,</hi> he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to his friends and acquaintance, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting that they were enriched with the like and many other virtues; So that within twelve mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths after, all ſorts of ſick perſons did begin to reſort unto them, and that from all places of the Country. The manifold commendations which I did every where hear uttered, concerning their virtues and effects, did beget in me a longing deſire after a ſight and tryal of them; eſpecially ſeing I could never hear from any, of a reaſon for the vulgar opinion concerning them.</p>
                  <p>Two years are not yet expired, ſince the Earl of <hi>Hartfield,</hi> (to whoſe former titles of <hi>honour,</hi> His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> ſince His happy reſtoration to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this His ancient <hi>Kingdom,</hi> hath added the Title of <hi>Annnadale,</hi> becauſe of his Lordſhip and his Anceſtors, their ſingular Loyalty) was pleaſed to command the dreſſing of the Wells; So that the entry into them is much bettered, and their diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is made more perſpicuous, by the removal of the clay, and the ſurrounding of them with a wall.</p>
                  <p>The ſtones of the upper Well are white and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline, and the neather hath blackiſh ſtones, not much unlike unto the <hi>markaſite</hi> of <hi>Antimony.</hi> Thus

                  <p>The limpide Waters of the Wells of <hi>Moffet</hi> are impregnat with the putide <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Nitre,</hi> and natural <hi>Salt-Amoniack.</hi>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59896:24"/>when ſome drops of <hi>Aqua-regia</hi> (which is made of <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> and <hi>Salt-amoniack</hi>) are inſtilled into it. Now the ſmell of the water of the Wells, is moſt like to the ſmell of the droſs of powder, which remaineth in <hi>Guns</hi> which have been often ſhot.</item>
                        <item> 2. This artificial Water tinctureth <hi>Silver,</hi> as the water of the Wells do.</item>
                        <item> 3. In this water precipitateth the putide Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which is rediſh-yellow; or rather the Antimonial atoms, wherein the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Sulphur doth reſide. And the ſtones of the Upper-well are covered with a matter, very much reſembling the ſame.</item>
                        <item> 4. The ſtones of the Neather-well are a little coloured like <hi>Antimony,</hi> and ſome of them do contain a metallick like matter, which doth ſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillat almoſt like unto Antimony.</item>
                        <item> 5. As the Water of the Neather-well deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth into the preterlabent rivolet, a matter whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and ſalinous (and without doubt Nitrous wherein the diuretick virtue of the Water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideth) doth attach it ſelf unto the rocks.</item>
                        <item> 6. There appeareth no ſuch matter upon the rocks, by which the water of the Upper-well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth; becauſe the ſaltiſh and ſcintillating ſtones) of the Well have already detained and ſeparated the ſame from the Water.</item>
                        <item> 7. It is hence probable, that the Sulphur of the Upper-well will evaporat ſooner, then that of the Neather; becauſe it's Water containeth but little
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59896:24"/>ſalt, which ſhould detain the evaporating Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur: for <hi>ſalt detaineth Sulphur,</hi> and the ſmell proceedeth from the evaporating Sulphur, as ſhall afterwards be proven.</item>
                        <item> 8. Before the evaporation of the Sulphur, the water doth not depoſe its ſalt upon the rocks; elſe it would be attached to the very inmoſt ſtones of the Neather-well (which is falſe) as well as to the outmoſt.</item>
                        <item> 9. The whitiſh ſtones of the Upper-well are nitrous and Antimonial: for when their double quantity of <hi>Nitre</hi> is added to them, and they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards calcined in a Mortar, they take flame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner, that <hi>Antimony</hi> calcined with <hi>Nitre</hi> doth, and become like unto <hi>Diaphoretick Antimony.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item> 10. Whilſt this mixture is a calcining, it melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and boileth as <hi>Allom</hi> caſt upon a hot <hi>Iron,</hi> and contracteth great ſaltneſs and acrimony.</item>
                        <item> 11. When I was calcining one of thoſe white ſtones (gifted by a friend) with its anatick quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and when I had cauſed pulverize the ſame, and mixed it with fountain water, there did immediatly ariſe a ſmell moſt like to that of the Wells.</item>
                        <item> 12. When a little deſtilled <hi>Vinegar</hi> is inſtilled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water wherewith the <hi>Saffran of Mettals</hi> was waſhed, the like ſmell and precipitation are produced; and this mixture doth inquinat <hi>Silver</hi> with the colour of <hi>Copper.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59896:25"/>13. The putide ſulphur of the water of <hi>Moffet</hi>-Wells doth ſtill evaporat; ſo that within few dayes the moſt limpide water is left deſtitute of all ſmell.</item>
                        <item> 14. The putide ſulphur of the artificial water doth likewiſe evaporat; yea, the ſimple water (without <hi>Vinegar</hi>) wherewith the <hi>Saffran of Mettals</hi> was waſhed, becometh deſtitute of all putide ſulphur, when it is preſerved for the ſpace of three or four months: becauſe it doth eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porat out of the alien humide body, and relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the antimonial atoms (wherein it did reſide) ſeparable by precipitation, upon the copious affu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fountain water.</item>
                        <item> 15. From whence proceedeth the vomitive and purgative virtue of the water, if not from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony?</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>We do therefore reject the common opinion, viz. <hi>That the fore-mentioned water runneth through mineral ſulphur or Brimſtone, and that it borroweth its putide ſmell from it.</hi>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59896:33"/>in neither of theſe two bodies; and that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth not this heat, appeareth hence, that the moſt rectified Spirit of <hi>Wine</hi> (which is moſt eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflamed) when mixed with <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> whilſt it is diſſolving <hi>Iron,</hi> conceiveth not flame, but doth debilitat the action, and totally prohibite it for a time: But we ſhall eaſily ſhew, that <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> and every <hi>acide Spirit</hi> (as the Spirits of <hi>Vitriol, Nitre, Brimſtone,</hi> &amp;c.) which do veſicat, burn, as it were, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not hot but cold; by proving, that every <hi>Salt</hi> (eſpecially the fixed) is cold, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fore-mentioned <hi>Spirits</hi> and water, are only <hi>Salts</hi> converted into Liquors, either by the heat of the fire or humide air.</p>

                  <p>You would here take notice, that the cauſe of <hi>Thirſt</hi> which is by <hi>Ariſtotle, in his ſecond Book of the Soul,</hi> called, <hi>a deſire after a humide and frigide body</hi>) is two-fold, <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internal;</hi> each whereof is either <hi>hot,</hi> or <hi>corroſive</hi> and <hi>cold:</hi> For <hi>corroſives</hi> are really different from ſuch things as are <hi>hot,</hi> as ſhall afterwards appear, from what hath been, and is to be ſaid. 1. The <hi>internal hot
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59896:35"/>cauſe of thirſt,</hi> is a hot diſtemper of the whole body (as in a <hi>Feaver</hi>) or of ſome part of it, as of the <hi>Stomach, Liver,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The <hi>external hot cauſe of thirſt,</hi> is the radical heat of meat or drink, exiſting in their ſulphureous parts, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a hot diſtemper in the ſtomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. The <hi>internal corroſive cauſe of thirſt,</hi> is a <hi>bilious, ſalt,</hi> and <hi>corroſive humor,</hi> which corrodeth the skin of the ſtomach, and by motion, in the ſolution of continuity, conciliateth heat in the corroded part only, whereas the heat of meat and drink do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times produce a hot diſtemper in the whole body, each of whoſe parts, after the concoctions, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meateth. 4. The <hi>external corroſive cauſe of thirſt,</hi> is the corroſive ſalts of meat and drink, which do corrode the ſtomach, as before. For the cure of <hi>thirſt,</hi> proceeding from a hot cauſe (whether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or internal) a body radically and actually cold and humide, is neceſſarily required. But for the cure of <hi>thirſt</hi> proceeding from a corroſive cauſe, a humide body, radically only (though not actually) cold, is ſufficient, wherein the <hi>Salts</hi> may be diſſolved; which being done in a copious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide body, they become ſo debilitat, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any more corrode the skin of the ſtomach: for <hi>diſjoyned virtue or ſtrength is weaker.</hi> Now this ſolution is more eaſily effectuat in a humide body which is actually hot, than in one which is cold. This ſort of <hi>thirſt</hi> is curable alſo by <hi>Pearls, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> &amp;c. For when ſuch things are put into the ſtomach, the <hi>Salt</hi> of the corroſive humor doth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59896:35"/>affix it ſelf to the atoms of the <hi>Pearls, Coral,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo the humor is dulcified (as is <hi>Vinegar,</hi> when affuſed to <hi>Corals, Red-lead,</hi> &amp;c.) and loſeth its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive quality, and then the <hi>thirſt</hi> ceaſeth.</p>
                  <p>Here we cannot but inquire after the cauſe and cure of that common and troubleſome diſtemper, vulgarly called <hi>the Heart-ſcade.</hi> We conceive that it is cauſed by acide and corroſive humors, which being congeſted into the ſtomach, do irritat its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultrix faculty, ſo that they are conſtrained to mount upwards to the throat, where the greateſt pain and trouble is found; becauſe the corroſive humor having excoriat the <hi>Oeſophage</hi> or <hi>Wezand,</hi> it is ſtill moſt ſenſible of the mordication of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which is moſt active upon the uppermoſt part, upon which it beateth with violence: So this may be called <hi>an imperfect vomiting;</hi> becauſe there is but little or nothing expelled at the mouth, the humor deſcending again into the ſtomach. The cure of this turbulent diſtemper conſiſteth, 1. either in the evacuation of the peccant humor, (which is the perfect cure) or, 2. in the correcting of its corroſive quality by dulciſication; or, 3. in prohibiting this aſcenſion of it to the throat, which are palliative cures: As to the firſt, the only beſt way for evacuating of the peccant humor is vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for <hi>Art</hi> ought to imitat <hi>Nature,</hi> and aſſiſt her in her attempts which tend to the good of the creature. The ſecond ſort of cure by dulciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is (as we conceive) three-fold; 1. by drinking of the pureſt fountain water in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59896:36"/>and at five of the clock in the after-noon, when the ſtomach is empty. I am confident that the water of <hi>Moſſet-Wells</hi> will cede to none for this uſe; becauſe it will not only dulcifie the corroſive humor, but alſo help to expell it by ſtool. The perſon may drink more or leſs, according to his, or her age. 2. By <hi>Corals, Pearls,</hi> and ſuch like, as was ſaid a little before concerning the cure of <hi>thirſt.</hi> 3. By the uſing of <hi>Salts,</hi> either purely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as Sea-ſalt, or which have been by art extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>vegetables,</hi> as <hi>Worm-Wood,</hi> &amp;c. This will certainly appear as a great Paradox (if not a falſehood) to all who are ignorant of our <hi>Spagyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal art,</hi> and particularly of the operations of <hi>ſalts</hi> of different properties, upon one another. But for the evincing of the truth of what hath been ſaid, I will firſt relate a ſtory, and then give the reaſon of the effect. A near friend of mine own, who was as much moleſted with this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as any other ever was, eſſayed all the cures which were known to any with whom he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed concerning that diſeaſe, but the moſt ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of all, he found to be the cating of a little of the <hi>ſalteſt Beef</hi> in the morning; after doing of which, he was not at all aſſaulted by the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that day. Now the reaſon of this effect is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to be none other than the operation of the <hi>ſalt</hi> of the <hi>Beef,</hi> upon the <hi>ſalt</hi> of the <hi>corroſive humor,</hi> by which it was dulcified. As in the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Tartar-Vitriolat,</hi> the <hi>Oyls</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Vitrial</hi> (which are moſt ſalt, ſharp and corroſive)
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59896:36"/>being mixed, do produce a liquor altogether in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide. The third way of curing this diſeaſe is by prohibiting the aſcenſion of the humor to the throat. This is done by the drinking of the ſpirit of <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Aqua-vita,</hi> which do prohibit the ebulition of the humor, and conſequently the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of it, or of vapors from it, unto the throat: For either of theſe being mixed with <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> when it is diſſolving <hi>Iron,</hi> will prohibit and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the action and ebullition of the corroſive li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. This is the worſt of all cures; for although the perſon will get preſent eaſe, yet the diſtemper will recidivat more violently than before; becauſe the corroſive liquor is not only by the remedy aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in its quantity, but alſo in the degrees of its corroſive quality: for the corroſive liquor in the ſtomach doth ſix the volatile ſpirits of the <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> and ſo converteth them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt into its own nature; as you read before in the Preface, concerning the <hi>natural compoſed ferment.</hi> I will add a fourth way of curing this diſtemper, <hi>viz.</hi> the taking of ſuch things as will imbibe the corroſive humor in the ſtomach, and carry it unto the inteſtines. I mention this, becauſe I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that one who was moleſted with this diſtemper, uſed to eat a great quantity or number of <hi>Groats</hi> made of <hi>Oats,</hi> and ſo was eaſed. The ordinary cure by drinking of ſweet <hi>Milk,</hi> cannot but be reprehended: for though it eaſe a little at firſt, yet it cauſeth a recidivation when it is fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> and becometh acide, as in a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59896:37"/>

                  <p n="4">4. Every pure fixed <hi>ſalt</hi> is radically <hi>humide,</hi> without the admiſtion of any ſulphureous and combuſtible matter, (for by fuſory calcination it is converted into a Liquor) therefore it is alſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically <hi>cold.</hi> I ſaid, <hi>without the admiſtion,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe every ſulphureous ſubſtance is alſo radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally humide.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Such bodies as contain more perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted and combuſtible <hi>ſulphur</hi> then others, are commonly (and deſervedly) called <hi>hot;</hi> as are theſe Spices, <hi>Cinnamon, Nutmegs,</hi> &amp;c. and the ſulphureous ſpirit of <hi>Wine:</hi> and contrarywiſe, ſuch as contain leſs of the foreſaid <hi>ſulphur</hi> than others, are ſaid to be <hi>cold,</hi> as <hi>Lettice, Purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, Cichory</hi> (whoſe great bitterneſs proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from <hi>ſalt</hi> and <hi>ſulphur</hi>) &amp;c. and the corroſive parts of many Vegetables (ſo called, becauſe they diſſolve <hi>Pearles, Coral,</hi> &amp;c.) as <hi>Vinegar,</hi> the <hi>juyce of Lemmons,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>cold,</hi> without all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. Now we deſire to know, why ſuch as acknowledge <hi>Vinegar,</hi> &amp;c. to be <hi>cold,</hi> do deny the ſalts of <hi>Tartar,</hi> &amp;c. (which are altogether void of <hi>ſulphur</hi>) to be alſo <hi>cold,</hi> ſeing they are of the ſame nature? For, the acidity and corroſive quality of the <hi>Vinegar,</hi> do exiſt in it's <hi>ſalt,</hi> which albiſieth the atoms of the <hi>Coral, Lead,</hi> &amp;c. which are diſſolved by it, (for every purified <hi>ſalt</hi> is white) and this <hi>ſalt</hi> is the very ſelf ſame <hi>ſalt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> ſo diſſolved in an aqueous body, that it is inſeparable by deſtillation, without the addition
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59896:37"/>of ſome other body: for, the acide Liquor of every body, which is commonly called <hi>Mercury,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a little of the <hi>ſalt</hi> (eſpecially) <hi>fixed</hi> of the ſame body, diſſolved in the aqueous part; which appeareth hence, that in the abſtraction of deſtilled <hi>Vinegar</hi> from <hi>Lead</hi> or <hi>Coral</hi> which it diſſolved, whenſoever the ſulphureous Spirit (of which in the Preface) exſtilleth, the next inſuing Liquor is almoſt inſipide, as water; becauſe it's <hi>ſalt</hi> (which did formerly render it acide) hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken it, and betaken it ſelf to the atoms of the body which it diſſolved, and now doth albiſie. Moreover, there is no corroſive body which is not ſaltiſh, neither any ſaltiſh body which is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive; neither doth the ſulphureous Spirit of <hi>Wine,</hi> it's extraction of the <hi>reſine</hi> out of <hi>Jalap,</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſie this; for it extracteth it not by a corroſive quality (becauſe it is void of <hi>ſalt,</hi> and therefore corrodeth not the terreſtrial part of <hi>Jalap,</hi> dividing it into atoms, as <hi>Vinegar</hi> doth <hi>Lead</hi>) but by a real firy heat, which liquifieth the <hi>Refine,</hi> and exiſteth in the ſulphureous and inſlamable <hi>Spirit,</hi> and from thence proceedeth the mutation of the colour; for, the Spirit of <hi>Wine</hi> which is impregnat with the <hi>Refine</hi> of <hi>Jalap,</hi> is almoſt tinctured with redneſs.</p>
                  <p>It doth hence appear, that the frigidity of <hi>Nitre</hi> may be queſtioned, ſeing it containeth much <hi>ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> though indigeſted; as appeareth hence, 1. <hi>Nitre</hi> cannot be diſſolved by deliquation, as the reſt of <hi>ſalts</hi> which are voide of <hi>ſulphur,</hi> before that the <hi>ſulphur</hi> be ſeparated from it by calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

I did truly eſſay this, but to no purpoſe; for this matter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be liquified, without the moſt intenſe heat of the fire, and then it is only converted into a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, like unto the <hi>litharge of Gold;</hi> the reaſon whereof is moſt probably thus, <hi>viz</hi> that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive <hi>ſalt</hi> of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> which hath affixed it ſelf unto the atoms of the <hi>Lead,</hi> can never be ſeparated from them (for which conſult the <hi>Animadverſions of</hi> Dr. <hi>John Zuelfer,</hi> upon the <hi>Magiſterial gouder,</hi> deſcribed in the <hi>Auguſtan Pharmacopoeia</hi>) and prohibiteth the liquation of thoſe atoms (which of themſelves are moſt eaſily melted) before that it ſelf be melted, which requireth a moſt intenſe degree of heat: for it is of the ſame nature with the <hi>ſalt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> as was ſaid, which is nor eaſily melted. Theſe things are moſt true, and being calculated according to their ſeeming altitude in the <hi>meridian</hi> of <hi>reaſon,</hi> would appear to be nearer the <hi>Zenith</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> than our ſixth <hi>argument;</hi> But the contrary will evidently appear, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that it happeneth not ſo in all; for although you ſhould a thouſand times diſſolve, and, as it were, annihilat <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> by the ſtrongeſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59896:39"/>and cauſticks (as they call them) yet a little heat will revivify it again, and cauſe it recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat its priſtine form, <hi>Proteus</hi>-like. And yet the ſelf ſame <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> which is moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of the heat of fire (for it flyeth from its veſicating and depilating degree, and far more rather its actual touch, by which it is quite diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated) eſheweth not the moſt intenſe (ſomniat) heat of corrofive bodies, nor is it diſſipated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but only converted into moſt minute atoms, and that without the deſtruction of its proper and natural temperament. Therefore, ſuch things as are (as it were) burned by corroſives, are not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and deſtroyed by any <hi>fiery</hi> and <hi>hot</hi> ſubſtance, but only converted into moſt ſmall atoms, by a <hi>corroſive</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> one, without the deſtruction of their proper and natural temperaments.</p>
                  <p>It is no ſmall ground of admiration to me, that no <hi>Chymicall</hi> writer which I have ſeen or heard of, did ever expreſly aſſign unto their <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Elements,</hi> firſt qualities; as did the <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Philoſophers,</hi> who attributed <hi>heat</hi> to <hi>fire, his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity</hi> to <hi>air, frigidity</hi> to <hi>water,</hi> and <hi>ſiccity</hi> to <hi>earth.</hi> I will therefore further attempt the proving of <hi>Salt</hi> to be radically <hi>cold,</hi> and <hi>Sulphur hot,</hi> from the moſt learned aſſertions of the moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ingenious Phyſician Dr. <hi>Thomas Willis.</hi> I will begin with the laſt, being leaſt controverted, and ſooneſt diſpatched.</p>

                  <p>I am confident, that none, who have any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Nature and her admirable works, will deny, that the moſt compact, (<hi>Diamond</hi>) ſolid, (<hi>Gold</hi>) ponderous, (<hi>Lead</hi>) durable (<hi>Silver</hi>) bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, are radically <hi>cold;</hi> the exiſtence of which quality in them, is further demonſtrat by their long reſiſting the violence of fire (which is the moſt violent and agile diſſolver of the natural uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Bodies) their congelation and coagulation, whereby they are capacitat to deny obedience to the greateſt violence (excepting that of <hi>mallea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>)

That the intenſe <hi>heat</hi> of waters that boyl in fountains, ought not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be attributed unto fire (as ſaid Dr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Baccius</hi>) but rather to the action of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive body, as of <hi>Nitre, Vitriol,</hi> &amp;c. being not far diſtant from the fountain.</p>

If there were any <hi>ſalt Ammoniack</hi> mixed with the water of <hi>Mof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet-Wells,</hi> without all doubt, it would aſſix it ſelf with the <hi>Nitre,</hi> unto the white and ſalinous ſtones, from which it might afterwards be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by ſublimation, ſeing it is by nature moſt volatile, but ſo it is, that nothing can be ſeparated
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59896:42"/>from them by ſublimation, as our own experience did teſtifie. To this we anſwer, 1. that a very little quantity of <hi>ſalt Amoniack,</hi> produceth the fore-mentioned precipitation, as appeareth in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry precipitation. 2. The <hi>ſalt amoniack</hi> is fixed, by the fixed ſalt of the <hi>Nitre</hi> and ſtones, ſo that it cannot be ſeparated from them by ſublimation; and this is moſt probable, if it be conſidered, that <hi>ſalt ammoniack</hi> is commonly ſixed, when it is by ſtratification calcined with the pouder of <hi>Lime:</hi> For then the ſixed ſalt of the <hi>Coals,</hi> which hath by calcination affixed it ſelf unto the earth and ſixed ſalt of the ſtones, doth ſix the <hi>ſalt amoniack,</hi> and rendereth it diſſolvable into an Oyl (impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, becauſe not ſulphureous) by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation. 3. Or rather (becauſe moſt probable) the volatile <hi>ſalt ammoniack,</hi> being diſſolved in a ſtrange humide and aqueous body (<hi>viz.</hi> the water of the Wells) doth evaniſh with the evaporating Sulphur: for, in every d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I anſwer, 1. there is here no need of deſtillation: for the water of the Wells is only impregnat with <hi>Nitre</hi> and the pntide Sulphur of <hi>Antimony;</hi> the former whereof is proven by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſeing the <hi>Nitre</hi> doth affix it ſelf to the rocks, by which the water deſcendeth, and the latter is already ſhown by an experiment. 2.

The deſtilling of the water would prove a finſtraneous action; 1. becauſe it would require a vaſt quantity of water, for to acquire but a very little of the ſalt: for there is but little of it contained in the water, as appeareth by the rocks; for there is but

                  <p>EXperience having taught, that many have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten much good by the uſe of this water, and that others have reaped more harm, and finiſhed their miſerable lives ſoon after their making uſe of it; the difficulty of deſcribing its virtues, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond controverſie, as alſo that it were a moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult task, to ſhew who ſhould make uſe of it, and at what time; becauſe ſome have been bettered (yes cured) by it at one time, and wronged at another, when they have addreſſed themſelves unto it, for prevention only of that diſeaſe, which had once been cured by it. Therefore I ſhall only propoſe ſome general rules, concerning its internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal uſe: For no man can preſcribe to all ſorts of perſons particular rules, for uſing it internally, unleſs he had been an eye-witneſs for two or three years, to its different operations, upon perſons of different conſtitutions. Now the rules are theſe,

                  <p>From theſe, and what hath been formerly ſaid, concerning the natures of Sulphur and Salt, let each perſon infer what they pleaſe, concerning the temperature of <hi>Antimony.</hi> For my own part, I am of opinion, that the vomitive and purgative faculties of <hi>Antimony,</hi> do not proceed from its temperament (ſeing there are many other bodies of the ſame temperature with it, according to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, which have uſurped this determining power, which yet have none of theſe faculties of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>) but from its natural form, which the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> of all things hath beſtowed upon it.</p>
                  <p>As for that opinion of this Author, <hi>viz. that crude or natural Antimony, being cold in the third degree, and dry in the ſecond, is by burning or preparing it any way, ſo metamorphoſed, that it becometh hot and dry in the fourth degree</hi> (which he foundeth upon the opinion of others, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm a reaſon of his own) I cannot ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire it; becauſe I conceive it to be without the reach of any created being, to induce the fourth degree of any of the firſt qualities (which are by <hi>Philoſophers</hi> attributed to the pure <hi>Elements</hi> only) upon any compoſed body, ſuch as is <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;</hi>

If <hi>Venenum</hi> be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (as <hi>Sennertus</hi> alſo doth) <hi>id omne quod aptum eſt nobis vehementer nocere, per occultam agendi rationem,</hi> it is undeniable that <hi>Antimony</hi> is one of thoſe: as alſo <hi>Wine</hi> (immoderatly and unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably taken) <hi>Saffran,</hi> and what not.

                  <p>As to the ſecond (which is a moſt confident aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deſtitute of probation, and moſt unbeſeeming a Phyſician, who for each of his aſſertions, ought to have <hi>in promptu cauſam</hi>) I do firſt deny <hi>Lead</hi> to be poyſon, in any other reſpect, than I have conceded <hi>Antimony, Wine</hi> and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſſran</hi> to be ſuch, in the fourth anſwer. And ſecondly, I deny the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59896:48"/>conſequence: for ſimilitude of external formes, can never infer a ſimilitude of internals, eſpecially when the effects flowing from both the internal formes, are moſt diſcrepant, as in <hi>Antimony</hi> and <hi>Lead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the third, that <hi>it emitteth a virulent and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous ſmell and exhalation, like that of orpament, from which (as from preſent poyſon) Chymiſts do adviſe to preſerve the noſe.</hi> I anſwer firſt, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe exhalations are poyſonous: for I have often breathed the air, that was vitiat with both (and ofteſt that of <hi>Orpament,</hi> yea, of <hi>Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> itſelf, when burned) yet was never prejudiced.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though it were true, that the exhalation of <hi>Antimony</hi> is poyſonous, doth it argue that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> after calcination (whereby it is freed from that poyſonous exhalation) is ſtill venomous? It doth certainly demonſtrat the contrary (as in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony Diaphoretick</hi>) or at leaſt, that its venenoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is much diminiſhed, as in <hi>Crocus Metallorum.</hi> Moreover, is not the fleſh of <hi>vipers,</hi> an excellent <hi>Alexipharmick</hi> or antidot againſt poyſon, when the head and gall (wherein its venom doth reſide, according to <hi>Schroderus</hi>) are ſeparated from it?</p>
                  <p>To the fourth, <hi>viz. that it is imperfectly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Borax, Treacle,</hi> &amp;c.) I anſwer, 1. this Author ſhould have evinced by reaſon, that none of thoſe mentioned <hi>Alexipharmicks,</hi> were capable to correct the venenoſity of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and not have given his <hi>nudam aſſertionem</hi> for it. 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he and his informers could never attain the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59896:48"/>skill of preparing it, ſo as that it would not produce any of thoſe ſad ſymptoms; ſhould others who have attained it, be by him, or any, prohibited to uſe it; when frequent experience hath diſcovered unto them the innocency and uſefulneſs of its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>As for the fifth, <hi>the ſad and lamentable ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which it produceth.</hi> I anſwer, that I never found the like, ſave once, notwithſtanding of which I have ſtill made uſe of it, with good ſucceſs; and therefore every one would make uſe of it, as he ſhall find encouragment, from its peaceable beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the ſixth (viz. <hi>that it purgeth not elective,</hi> as they ſay, <hi>any peculiar humor, as others do,</hi> viz. <hi>Bile, Melancholy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly all, both good and bad</hi>) I anſwer, 1. that it is well aſſerted, but ill proven. 2.

Yet whenſoever a potion compoſed of either ſort is exhibited to any perſon, it doth promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly evacuat a part of each of thoſe humors which it encountereth; and this is undeniable by my who have been diligent obſervers of the <hi>egeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a,</hi> which (in valetudinary perſons) is as neceſſary, as the noticeing of the <hi>ingeſta.</hi> 3. The aſſertion may
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59896:49"/>be denied: for I have known an Antimonial poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on evacuat a pound of <hi>Bilis porracea,</hi> which was the only cauſe of a conſtant vomiting two or three hours after meat, all that the perſon had taken at the laſt meal; as alſo another pound of <hi>Bilis Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellina,</hi> mixed with <hi>pituita ſalſa;</hi> wherewith the internal wrinckled ſuperfice of the ſtomach, being, as it were, daubed, it and the other humor occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned an indigeſtion of the meat: and in others produceth either a <hi>lienteria</hi> (when meat is evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by ſtool, without being at all altered by the ſtomach, which being ſlippery, cannot retain it; as when its wrinckles were not daubed with the humor) or <hi>Coelica paſſio,</hi> wherein meat is excerned after being but a little altered.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, he affirmeth, <hi>that Antimony pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not of it ſelf (as other purgatives do) but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally.</hi> This is all one as if he had ſaid, that <hi>Antimony</hi> purgeth, as drink, fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which are not purgative of themſelves) do, when a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath taken a ſurfet of them, whereby nature being oppreſſed, it doth impetuouſly expell them and other humors, both good and bad, with them. The falſity of this is ſo palpable, that it were folly to ſet about the refuting of it.</p>
                  <p>The eighth is an irrefragable truth.</p>
                  <p>The ninth doth not well expreſs the Authors meaning, which I conceive was (at leaſt ſhould have been) this, that ſo long as the natural miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the conſtituent parts of <hi>Antimony,</hi> is not altered by fire, the vomitive and purgative faculties
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59896:49"/>of it, do not diſcover themſelves, but ſo ſoon as the Sulphur is freed in ſome meaſure from the bonds of ſalt, by which it was formerly fettered, it doth communicat it ſelf unto the affuſed liquor, and draweth along with it the nitrous volatile ſalt, in both which reſideth the vomitive and purgative virtues of <hi>Antimony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall add (for a <hi>Colophon</hi>) the reaſon why the foreſaid water worketh not, but when it is taken by pounds, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it is impregnat only with the putide Sulphur of <hi>Antimony:</hi> for if it were inriched with the Earth, volatile ſalt, and beſt Sulphur (that is, ſuch as is not become putide, by recrudeſcing in fermentation) of <hi>Antimony,</hi> as is <hi>Spaniſh Wine,</hi> wherein the <hi>Saffran</hi> of <hi>Mettals</hi> hath been infuſed, it would, by ounces (as this doth) commove and purge out the humors, and contain ſuch a matter as would be precipitable by ſome liquor: for the earth of <hi>Antimony</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in do exiſt the Sulphur and volatile ſalt, which commove and purge out the humors) doth by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation ſeparat it ſelf from <hi>Spaniſh Wine,</hi> when ſome drops of <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> are mixed with it. But the water of the Wells containeth no precipitable matter. Now that the vomitive and purgative qualities of <hi>Antimony,</hi> exiſteth in the Sulphur and volatile ſalt, is hence proven, that <hi>Diaphoretick Antimony</hi> (which is <hi>Antimony</hi> that is totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Sulphur and volatile ſalt, by calcination) is neither purgative nor vomitive; and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed <hi>flowers</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> are moſt purgative
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59896:50"/>and vomitive. And hence it appeareth, that in <hi>Diaphoretick Antimony,</hi> the virtue of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> which attracteth and purgeth humors, is not impriſoned, but baniſhed, by <hi>Nitre.</hi>

In the 25. page of the forementioned Book, the Author an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to this argument, ſaying, <hi>that flame is nouriſhed two wayes;</hi> 1. <hi>When it followeth its food, as in the burning of wood.</hi> 2. <hi>When the food follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the flame, as doth Oyl in a Lamp: and thus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the flame of the Bitumen nouriſhed; neither is this falſified by the flame of Brimſtone, which followeth the mater. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen is melted by the great heat, and ſo it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the flame, and continueth the flame in the ſame place.</hi> But I reply, 1. That <hi>flame</hi> doth alwaies follow its <hi>food,</hi> neither doth <hi>Oyl</hi> follow the <hi>flame</hi> in a <hi>Lamp;</hi> but one part of the <hi>Oyl</hi> being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous to another, doth follow it, whilſt it is a conſuming by the <hi>flame.</hi> That you may the better underſtand this, you would take notice of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why ſome ſulphureous bodies (as <hi>Camphire, Turpentine,</hi> &amp;c.) do of themſelves take and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>flame;</hi> when others (as <hi>Tallow, Bees-wax, Oyl of Olives,</hi> &amp;c.) do neither take nor conſerve it, but by the help of others, as of <hi>Linnen cloath, Paper, Ruſhes,</hi> &amp;c. The cauſe of theſe things we conceive, yea affirm, to be this, that the firſt ſort are bodies which contain much <hi>Salt</hi> (for they are very ſapide) which doth ſtill detain the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> even when it is converted into <hi>flame;</hi> and the laſt ſort are bodies almoſt void of <hi>Salt</hi> (becauſe inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59896:52"/>almoſt) which do not take <hi>flame;</hi> becauſe they cannot conſerve it, unleſs they be aſſociat to the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of another body (containing much <hi>Salt,</hi> which detaineth its proper <hi>Sulphur</hi>) and ſo take <hi>flame</hi> with it. From theſe things it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that flame doth alwaies <hi>follow</hi> its <hi>food;</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeing the threeds of the <hi>Candle</hi> and <hi>Lamp,</hi> do waſt and conſume by the <hi>flame,</hi> whilſt it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the threeds, which is its food, whoſe conſumption is retarded by the <hi>Tallow</hi> in the <hi>Candle,</hi> and <hi>Oyl</hi> in the <hi>Lamp,</hi> which do nouriſh it. 2. It is not probable, that all the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen</hi> is liquified, 1. Becauſe the <hi>flame</hi> of the kindled <hi>Bitumen,</hi> liquifieth only the parts which are neareſt to its ſelf, as happeneth in a <hi>Candle, Brimſtone, red Wax,</hi> &amp;c. 2.

Nor can the <hi>flame</hi> of the kindled <hi>Bitumen,</hi> by heating the caverns of the earth, liquifie the reſt of the <hi>Bitumen:</hi> becauſe (as was ſaid) it is not probable, that there is a place in the bowels of the earth, which would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo much <hi>flame,</hi> as would, by its heat, liquifie all the <hi>Bitumen</hi> which is within four, five, or ſix miles unto it; the contrary whereof muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, be confeſſed, by him who will aſſert, that the <hi>flame</hi> of the kind led <hi>Bitumen,</hi> changeth not its place, by following its food.</p>

They are ſuch things as have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59896:59"/>through the <hi>Refrigeratory</hi> of my vulgar <hi>Brain,</hi> and which I offer to be rectified through the <hi>Serpens</hi> of a wiſer; that the World may be preſented with a <hi>Deſtillatum,</hi> which may prove <hi>magis reſtaurativum</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> than this will: For the <hi>world</hi> had never more need of ſuch a medicine, than in this our age, which hath (too too well) nurſed ſo many <hi>Charletans,</hi> as betake themſelves to no other employment than cheating all men, with ſome one medicine or other (as <hi>Coffe, Chocolat,</hi> or <hi>Jacolata,</hi> &amp;c.) to each of which they aſcribe more virtues, than any ten can have, and give them to all ſuch, as will be ſo fooliſh, as to hazard the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the aeconomy of their bodies, in the hands of thoſe, who are as ignorant of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the inſtrument wherewith they do it, as are the veſſels which contain them, and far more of the way of reſtoring the greatly diſturbed body, to its priſtine healthfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

Such <hi>blades</hi> are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſometimes to erect <hi>Stage-playes</hi> in the <hi>Macrocoſme,</hi> that by their skill in thoſe, they may allicite men to permit them, to erect the like in their <hi>Microcoſmes;</hi> which they often do, to the ſad lamentation of ſome.

                  </head>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the <hi>Paroch</hi> of <hi>Libberton</hi> (the Church whereof lyeth two miles ſouth-ward from <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) there is a <hi>Well</hi> at the Chappel of St. <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> which is diſtant from the Church, about a quarter of a mile, and is ſituat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the South-weſt) whoſe profundity equalleth the length of a Pike, and is alwaies replet with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and at the bottom of it there remaineth a great quantity of black <hi>Oyl,</hi> in ſome veins of the earth.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Majeſty King James</hi> the ſixth, the firſt <hi>Monarch</hi> of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> of bleſſed memory, had ſuch a great eſtimation of this rate <hi>Well,</hi> that when he returned from <hi>England,</hi> to viſit this His ancient Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>anno.</hi> 1617. he went in perſon to ſee it, and ordered, that it ſhould be built with ſtones from the bottom to the top, and that a door and a pair of ſtairs ſhould
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59896:61"/>be made for it, that men might have the more eaſie acceſs unto its bottom, for getting of the <hi>Oyl.</hi> This royal command being obeyed, the Well was adorned and preſerved, until the year, 1650, when that execrable <hi>Regicide</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cromwell,</hi> with his rebellious and ſacrilegious complices, did invade this <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and not only deface ſuch rare and antient monuments of <hi>Natures</hi> hand-work, but alſo the <hi>Synagogues</hi> of the God of <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before that we proceed any further, let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from whence the water of all <hi>Springs</hi> (ſuch eſpecially as are moſt frequently deprehended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or near unto, the tops of high mountains) do proceed. The opinions of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> concerning this affair, are theſe three, which are mentioned by <hi>Frambeſarius</hi> in his <hi>natural hiſtory,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Andrew Baccius de Thermis,</hi> lib. 1. cap, 2. and by Dr. <hi>John French,</hi> in his <hi>York-ſhire Span, chap.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Ariſtotles,</hi> viz. <hi>That theſe waters are generat of vapors (which are contained in the caverns of the earth) and of air (inſinuating it ſelf into them, by the conduits it encountreth) which are condenſed into water, by the frididity of the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, <hi>that theſe waters are only Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, which having inſinuat it ſelf into the veins of the earth, maketh way for its own egreſs, by the moſt convenient paſſages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:59896:61"/>The third is, <hi>that theſe waters come from the Sea, through the veins of the earth;</hi> according to that ſaying of <hi>Solomons</hi> (Eccleſiaſtes, 1.7. <hi>All rivers run into the Sea, yet the Sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again</hi>) who was <hi>the wiſeſt of all</hi> meer <hi>men, who were before or ſhould be after him,</hi> 1 Kings, 3.12. and that not only in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, but alſo in naturals: For the Scripture (1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 4.33) ſaith, <hi>that he ſpoke</hi> (by which you may well underſtand writing alſo) <hi>of Animals and Vegetables.</hi> He was alſo, no doubt, as skilfull in the art of <hi>Navigation,</hi> and knew well the natures of <hi>Minerals,</hi> ſeing (1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 9.26,27,28. and 10.22.) <hi>he made Navies of ſhips, which he ſent with his ſervants, that had knowledge of the Sea, unto</hi> Ophir <hi>and</hi> Tarſhiſh, <hi>from whence he brought gold and ſilver, in ſo great abundance, that in his dayes ſilver was nothing accounted of,</hi> 1 Kings, 10.21. He was alſo no leſs skilfull in <hi>Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as may appear from <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> 2.5. And his making of <hi>Pools</hi> of water (<hi>ver.</hi> 6.) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrateth his dexterous skill, in finding out the ſubterraneal paſſages of water.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt of theſe opinions, we cannot em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, becauſe of theſe reaſons, 1. It is moſt improbable, that there are ſuch large caverns in the earth, as will contain ſo great a quantity of vapors and air, as, being condenſed, would afford ſo much water, as doth daily ſcaturiat in ſprings, which are upon high mountains: For ten Gallons
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59896:62"/>of air will ſcarcely afford one Gallon of water, as all will acknowledge. We will make uſe of this argument, not only in relation to ſuch ſprings, as proceed from the tops of high mountains, but alſo in relation to ſome which are in lower places, and environed with mountains; one whereof we will inſtance, which perpetually, every moment yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth many Scots quarts of water; and it is that known Well in <hi>Carrick,</hi> at the <hi>Wel-tries,</hi> near to <hi>Maybol,</hi> unto which Well, no man (who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Country betwixt it and the Sea weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) will deny its original to be from thence. 2. If the water, which doth ſcaturiat from, or near unto the top of an high mountain, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from vapors, which have been condenſed in the caverns of the ſame mountains, theſe caverns being (of neceſſity) below the caverns from which the water iſſueth, it ſeemeth impoſſible, that the water can naturally aſcend, from the lower unto the higher parts of theſe caverns, which are at the tops of the mountains; becauſe <hi>water doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſcend no further, than it did deſcend.</hi> We will notwithſtanding acknowledge, 1. that there may be ſome ſprings upon, or near unto the tops of ſome mountains, which do not proceed from the <hi>Sea</hi> immediatly, but rather from ſome <hi>Logh,</hi> whoſe ſuperfice is more diſtant from the <hi>Centre</hi> of the earth, than the ſprings, and whoſe water cometh from the <hi>Sea</hi> immediatly, after that maner, of which you ſhall be informed afterwards. 2. When water iſſueth ſlowly from the lower part
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59896:62"/>of a mountain (as from St. <hi>Authonies Well,</hi> at <hi>Arthurs</hi> ſeat) it may proceed from vapors and air, which have been condenſed in the caverns of that ſame mountain which are above the place out of of which it iſſueth.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond opinion is no leſs improbable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is incredible, that the <hi>Rain-water,</hi> which doth at ſometimes only fall upon mountains and valleys, can be the only water, which doth perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſcaturiat in all fountains; and that as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly from ſome, after a long ſummers drought, as after the greateſt abundance of brumal ſhowers.</p>
                  <p>We will here likewiſe admit, that there be many ſprings iſſuing from mountains, which are furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no other water, than the bottles of the clouds do afford unto ſome valleys, whoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are further from the centre of the earth, than the foreſaid ſprings, whoſe waters are perpetually increaſed by <hi>Rain,</hi> and diminiſhed (totally ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) by drought. But theſe are not the ſprings, concerning the original of whoſe waters we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring; and therefore all arguments which are, or may be taken from them, can conclude nothing againſt <hi>Solomon</hi> his forementioned aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>The third opinion, which (as was ſaid) is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon <hi>Solomon</hi> his aſſertion, is alſo dubitable; becauſe it doth neceſſarily infer this improbable concluſion, <hi>viz. that the ſuperſice of the Sea, is higher (that is, further diſtant from the centre of the earth) than the orifices of theſe ſubterraneal veins, from which its water is alledged to iſſue
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59896:63"/>forth upon, or near unto the tops of mountains, though never ſo high; and that becauſe of the fore-mentioned</hi> Axiom, <hi>viz. Water doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſcend no further then it did deſcend;</hi> as is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily demonſtrat, by a ſtroup of white <hi>Iron,</hi> which is bowed at the middle.</p>
                  <p>The verity of the opinion, and validity of the conſequence will evidently appear, by proving the concluſion to be a certain truth; for the doing of of which, take theſe undeniable <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> from which we ſhall manifeſtly infer, that the waters of the moſt part of ſprings do come from the <hi>Sea,</hi> through the ſubterraneal veins; becauſe of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of its ſuperfice, beyond that of the higheſt mountains from which water ſpringeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 1. In the evening of the firſt day of the worlds creation, the four elements did ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round one another, that is, the <hi>water</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly ſurround the <hi>earth</hi> (Pſal. 104.5,6.) the <hi>air</hi> ſurrounded the <hi>water</hi> end the <hi>earth,</hi> and the element of <hi>fire</hi> (if there was or is ſuch a thing) did contain within its concavity, all the three.</p>
                  <p>The truth of this is evident from, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1,2. For in the firſt verſe it is expreſly ſaid, that <hi>in the beginning</hi> (that is, in the firſt day of the creation as <hi>ver.</hi> 5.) <hi>God created the heaven and the earth;</hi> and in the ſecond verſe, <hi>the earth was without form and void;</hi> that is, the form of the earth did not appear, becauſe it was compleatly covered with the waters, which upon the third day of the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>God did gather unto one place, that the dry land might appear,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59896:63"/>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 2. Before the gathering of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unto one place, the <hi>earth</hi> and the <hi>waters</hi> did conſtitute one rotund <hi>Globe,</hi> and never ſince, but when God commanded them, for drowning of the world, to return unto that their firſt poſition or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ituation, wherein <hi>their ſuperfice was fifteen cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits above the top of the higheſt mountain</hi> (Geneſ. 7.19.20.) And that, 1. through <hi>the fountains of the great deep</hi> (Gen. 7.11.) or <hi>veins of the earth</hi> (as Job, 38.8.) the latter half of which verſe, doth, without controverſie, relate to the <hi>floud of Noah.</hi> 2. Through <hi>the bottles of the clouds</hi> (unto which they had aſcended into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, and) from which they did deſcend, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing of the hard <hi>earth,</hi> that the ſubterraneal wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might the more eaſily conciliat a more facile egreſs unto themſelves, by new paſſages, through the ſuperfice of the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 3. From the third day of the worlds creation, untill the <hi>floud of Noah,</hi> and ſince that after the <hi>floud, the waters returned from off the face of the earth</hi> (Gen. 8.3.) and <hi>the dry land appeared</hi> (ver. 5.11,12) the middle of the ſuperfice of the <hi>Ocean</hi> (which we conceive moſt probably to be beneath the <hi>Arctick</hi> or <hi>North-pole</hi>) hath been, and is further diſtant from the <hi>centre</hi> of the <hi>earth,</hi> than the top of the higheſt mountain. This <hi>Propoſition</hi> is undenyable: for, if when the <hi>waters</hi> ſurrounded the whole <hi>earth,</hi> their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was fifteen cubits higher than the top of the higheſt mountain, far more is it higher now, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59896:64"/>hath been ever ſince they returned from off the earth; and that (no doubt) unto one (yea their former) place, unto which they were at firſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.9. Moreover, its truth is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evinced from <hi>Job.</hi> 38.10. <hi>I brake up for it my decreed place, and ſet bars and doors,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>And ſaid, hither to ſhalt thou come and no farther, and here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtayed.</hi> For theſe <hi>verſes,</hi> and the firſt words of <hi>ver.</hi> 8. of the ſame <hi>Chapter,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> 28. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. (<hi>He bindeth the flouds from over-ſlowing,</hi> &amp;c.) do no doubt relate unto the third day of the creation, whereon <hi>God did gather the waters unto one place</hi> (Gen. 1.9.) or unto <hi>the returning of the waters from off the earth</hi> (Gen. 8.3.) or both, which is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
                  <p>This third <hi>Propoſition</hi> is alſo proven, by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.5. <hi>Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it ſhould not be removed for ever,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>Thou covered'ſt it with the deep, as with a garment, the waters ſtood above the mountains,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>at thy rebuke they fled, at the voice of thy thunder they haſted away,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>they go up by the mountains, they go down by the valleys, uno the place which thou haſt founded for them,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>Thou haſt ſet a bound that they may not paſs over, that they turn not again to cover the earth;</hi> ver. 10. <hi>he ſendeth his ſprings</hi> (that is, permitteth the ſprings to paſs) <hi>among the hills.</hi> And, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.28. <hi>When he ſtrengthened the fountains of the deep,</hi> ver. 29. <hi>when he gvae to the Sea his decree, that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59896:64"/>the waters ſhould not paſs his commandment.</hi> Seing it is moſt evident, from theſe places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (eſpecially from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.9,10. and <hi>Job,</hi> 28.11. and 38.8.10,11.) that the <hi>Sea</hi> hath a natural and perpetual inclination unto turning again to cover the <hi>earth</hi> (whereby all the parts of its ſupeefice, may be equidiſtant from the <hi>centre</hi> of the <hi>earth</hi>) and that by the omnipotency only of God it is detained in that ſituation, wherein now it is, we do from them and the foreſaid propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons conclude, that the waters of all ſprings (even ſuch as do ſcaturiat upon the tops of the higheſt mountains) which run perpetually, do proceed from the <hi>Sea,</hi> through the ſubterraneal veins.</p>
                  <p>For further probation of this opinion, conſider, that if the ſuperfice of the <hi>Sea,</hi> where any of its water doth enter into the veins of the <hi>earth</hi> by which it is conveyed to the tops of high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, were not further diſtant from the <hi>centre</hi> of the <hi>earth</hi> than the tops of thoſe mountains, it could never aſcend unto them, no more than the water which iſſued from the top of an high mountain, could move in a natural maner (as it doth) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Sea-ſhore,</hi> if the place from whence it proceedeth, were not further diſtant from the <hi>centre</hi> of the <hi>earth</hi> than the <hi>ſhore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we cannot but take notice, how Dr. <hi>John French,</hi> in his <hi>York-ſhire Span,</hi> chap. 2. pag. 10, 11, 12. denieth, <hi>that the middle ſuperfice of the Ocean is higher than the ſhore, and that there are ſuch veins in the earth, as the water would paſs
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59896:65"/>through, unto the tops of mountains where ſprings are; becauſe the veins in the bowels of the earth, are not wholly and throughout full, as of neceſſity they muſt be, before water will aſcend through them, for preſervation of its continuity, and the avaiding of a</hi> vacuum, <hi>as thoſe crooked pipes are, by which Wine-coopers uſe to draw Wine out of our veſſel into another.</hi> For anſwer, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our former reaſons, we will as confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, as he doth deny, that the middle ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>Ocean</hi> is not only higher than the <hi>ſhore,</hi> but alſo higher than the higheſt mountain; and that theſe veins of the <hi>earth,</hi> are wholly, and throughout, full of water; becauſe if they were not ſo, the <hi>Sea-water</hi> could never ſcaturiat from the tops of high mountains.</p>
                  <p>The foreſaid <hi>Author</hi> having (as he thinketh) ſufficiently refuted that opinion, which aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the aſcent of the waters by the ſubterranea veins, which are in the mountains (though it be according to the expreſs Word of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.8.) <hi>They go up by the mountains, they go down by the valleys, unto the place which thou haſt founded for them</hi>) ſetteth down his own (<hi>pag.</hi> 15.16.) which is this, <hi>the water which proceedeth from the tops of mountains, is only the vapors of the waters contained in the caverns of the earth, which the ſubterraneal heat</hi> (<hi>of the burning Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> as pag. 22.) <hi>did elevat unto the heads of the ſprings, where they are condenſed into water, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the next place, we ſhall firſt give you that deſcription of the <hi>Well,</hi> which we find in <hi>J. Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peny</hi> his <hi>Memorial of the rare and wonderfull things of</hi> Scotland, at the end of his <hi>Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Scotiſh Chronicles.</hi> 2.

                  </p>
                  <p>As to to the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> I. M. his deſcription of the <hi>Well,</hi> theſe are his words. <hi>In</hi> Louthian, <hi>two miles from</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>is a Well-ſpring, called St.</hi> Catharines <hi>Well, flowing perpetually with a kind of black fatneſs or Oyl above the water, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding (as is thought) of the Parret coal, bring frequent in theſe parts. This fatneſs is of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous nature; for as the coal whereof it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, is judain to conceive fire or flame, So is this
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59896:66"/>Oyl of a ſudain operation, to heal all ſalt-ſcabs and humors, that trouble the outward skin of man; commonly the head and hands are quickly healed by the virtue of this Oyl. It renders a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſweet ſmell.</hi> Dr. <hi>Ja. Hart</hi> alſo maketh mention of it, to the ſame purpoſe, in his <hi>Dyet of the diſeaſed,</hi> Book 3 chap. 19. at the end.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Author</hi> of the forementioned deſcription is miſtaken; 1. In ſaying, that <hi>the Oyl floweth perpetually above the water;</hi> 2. In aſſerting, that <hi>it hath a marvellous ſweet ſmell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the latter aſſertion, it favoureth of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>information, becauſe the ſmell of the <hi>Oyl</hi> is moſt like unto the ſmell of the ſmoke of <hi>Coals,</hi> and their <hi>Oyl,</hi> which are no wayes gratefull or ſweet; and the firſt aſſertion is alſo of the ſame nature: For the <hi>Oyl</hi> remaineth in the veins of the earth, which are near unto the bottom of the Well, and doth never aſcend unto the ſuperfice of the water, but by drops only, and that when the water is commoved; becauſe ſome drops of the <hi>Oyl,</hi> are then ſeparated from the reſt, which are detained in the veins of the earth, through their viſcoſity, by which they are attached unto the earth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The manner of collecting the <hi>Oyl</hi> is this, the water of the <hi>Well</hi> being exhauſted by buckets, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the ſuperfice of that which remaineth, be as low as the orifices of thoſe veins, in which the <hi>Oyl</hi> is abſconded, when the ſuperfice of the water is often moved by a convenient veſſel, from the ſide of the <hi>Well,</hi> where theſe orifices are, unto the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59896:67"/>middle, the <hi>Oyl</hi> cometh forth of the veins, and floateth upon the water, from which it is ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>Cream</hi> from <hi>Milk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you would take notice, 1. that when the <hi>Well</hi> is full of water, there appeareth ſometimes: <hi>ſcum</hi> upon it, which is moſt delicatly vatiegat with theſe colours, <hi>blue, red, green, purple,</hi> &amp;c. (and <hi>Chamelion</hi>-like) changeth all theſe colours, according to the variation of its poſition unto your eyes, either by your moving, from one place unto another, round about the <hi>Well,</hi> or by its moving its place upon the water, by motion. The reaſon of this variation of colours, we conceive to be the different wayes of reflecting the rayes of light, by by the foreſaid <hi>ſcum,</hi> ſeing it is not altered by any other phyſical agent. 2. The water of the <hi>Well</hi> is ſcarcely affected with the taſte of the <hi>Oyl,</hi> ſo that it may be juſtly eſteemed as deſtitute of its other virtues. The reaſon of this is, becauſe its taſte (and conſequently its parts, wherein its virtues do confiſt) cannot be communicated unto the water, without the mediation of its <hi>ſalt,</hi> either <hi>fixed</hi> or <hi>volatile:</hi> But ſo it is, that the <hi>fixed-ſalt</hi> of the <hi>Coals,</hi> remaineth inſeparable from them, before they be calcined; and the <hi>volatile,</hi> being <hi>nitrous,</hi> is drawn along with the <hi>reſinous oyl,</hi> whereby its ſolution in the water is prohibited.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhall be demanded, what this <hi>Scum is?</hi> We anſwer, that it is nothing elſe, but one or more drops of the fore-mentioned <hi>oyl,</hi> which have been by agitation of the water, firſt ſeparated from tho
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59896:67"/>reſt, which lurketh in the ſubterraneal veins at the bottom of the Well, and then by a further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, extended over as much of the waters ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfice, as it could cover, when converted into a thin pellicule or <hi>ſcum.</hi> The truth of this is eaſily demonſtrat by this experiment; take one drop of the fore-mentioned <hi>oyl,</hi> and inſtill it into a large veſſel full of water, and then agitat the water with a ſtick, and you ſhall preſently perceive the like <hi>ſcum,</hi> which will vary its colours, as was ſaid. The <hi>Chymical Oyl of Worm-wood</hi> will do ſo alſo.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is moſt probable, that the foreſaid <hi>oyl,</hi> is the <hi>oyl of Coals:</hi> for proving of which, conſider, 1. that this <hi>oyl</hi> is moſt like, in colour, ſmell and taſte, unto the <hi>oyl,</hi> which is by the <hi>Spagyrical Art</hi> extracted out of <hi>Coals,</hi> ſave only in that it is not ſo ſtrong; becauſe it was not extracted by the violence of fire, as this, whoſe ſtrength exiſteth in its moſt active ſpirits, which the fire hath ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Coals.</hi> 2. The artificial <hi>oyl of Coals,</hi> is impregnat with the ſame virtue (but in a more eminent degree) which the <hi>Author</hi> aſcribeth unto the <hi>oyl</hi> of the <hi>Well,</hi> as experience hath often teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto me. 3. A drop of the artificial <hi>oyl</hi> of <hi>Coals,</hi> being inſtilled into a large veſſel full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by agitation it will be converted into a <hi>ſcum,</hi> which will vary its colours, after the ſame manner that the <hi>ſcum</hi> of the <hi>Well</hi> doth. 4. The adjacent ground, ſouth-wards, is full of <hi>Coal-pits</hi> and <hi>Lime-ſtones,</hi> which we conceive do tend unto the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59896:68"/>nature of <hi>Coals,</hi> and do differ only from them, as <hi>Silver</hi> differeth from <hi>Gold;</hi> and this difference is eaſily collected from that <hi>Axiom, Metallizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis finis eſt aurificatio.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Lime-ſtones</hi> are alwaies found near to <hi>Coals,</hi> as we are credibly informed,</p>
                  <p>Having already afferted, that this <hi>oyl</hi> is the <hi>oyl</hi> of <hi>Coals,</hi> we cannot but alſo confeſs, that we are of opinion, that it is the very <hi>oyl</hi> of the <hi>Parret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal;</hi> becauſe this is the moſt ſulphureous <hi>Coal,</hi> whoſe copious <hi>Sulphur,</hi> is of a moſt facile ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the abluent water, as it paſſeth through the veins of the <hi>earth,</hi> in which this ſort of <hi>Coal</hi> is contained.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whilſt the <hi>water</hi> of the <hi>Well</hi> paſſeth through the veins of the <hi>Earth,</hi> where the <hi>Coals</hi> are, it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth along with it, as much of the <hi>oyl,</hi> as ſerveth to make an unctuous <hi>ſcum</hi> upon its ſuperfice; and when it paſſeth through other veins of the <hi>earth</hi> into the <hi>Well,</hi> it encountereth ſome dryer parts, to which it attacheth it ſelf, untill it is converted into an <hi>oyl,</hi> by the contraction of its parts, and continual acceſſion of more pellicules. This is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proven by the forementioned experiment: For if one drop of the <hi>oyl</hi> be convertible into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous <hi>ſcum</hi> (as was proven) why ſhould any doubt, that the unctuous <hi>ſcum</hi> may be again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into <hi>oyl,</hi> by having its parts more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united?</p>
                  <p>We hope that none will queſtion the ſeparation of this <hi>oyl</hi> from <hi>Coals,</hi> which are a moſt ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is Dr. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> who wrote moſt learnedly upon the <hi>Cold-ſpring of King-horn,</hi> in <hi>anno.</hi> 1618. and in that his book, mentioneth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rare ſprings (wherewith <hi>Scotland</hi> is repleniſhed, and) which we will here inſert, becauſe that book is rare to be found.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59896:70"/>cotice of a ſtory, which will convince you of the poſſibility of this.

A very ingenious argument, for convincing ſo confident a <hi>Gain-ſayer.</hi> Secondly, a <hi>ſpring</hi> of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which himſelf did ſee in one of the vaults (which were moſt curiouſly hewed out of a ſolide rock) of <hi>Roſlain-caſtle.</hi> Thirdly, two <hi>Wells</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> diſtant two or three foots, the one from the other; the uppermoſt whereof, ſpringing from <hi>north</hi> to <hi>ſouth,</hi> yieldeth a very ſalt water; the other running from <hi>ſouth</hi> to <hi>north,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiteth freſh water. Fourthly, the <hi>Mud-earth wells of</hi> Menteith. Fifthly, the <hi>Lady-well of</hi> Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thearn. Sixthly, the <hi>Lady-well of</hi> Ruthven-Seventhly, this <hi>Oyly-well</hi> at St. <hi>Catharines Chappel.</hi>

                        <item> 8. His body is adorned (or rather deformed) with many <hi>lirks,</hi> by reaſon of the great quantity of fleſh.

                        <item> 10. His <hi>excrements</hi> are ſutable to his age, but not to his cating: ſo excellent is the digeſtive faculty of his <hi>ſtomach,</hi> and the attractive of his <hi>lacteous veſſels,</hi> that they permit nothing to be eliminat by the expultrix faculty, which can cede into aliment. The reaſon of this may, probably, be the ſuperlative vigor of the <hi>ferment</hi> of the <hi>ſtomach</hi> (the great inſtrument in chylification) which is occaſioned by the deficiency of that <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which is the great <hi>ſpermato-poetick</hi> agent: For <hi>the Former of all things</hi> uſeth mercifully to repair the natural defects of ſome members, by enabling others to exerce their natural offices, more extraordinarily, than naturally they uſe to do.

The goodneſs of his digeſtion is, doubtleſs, the cauſe of his exceſſive growing.</item>
                        <item> 11. The perſons who keep him did inform, that he was born of no bigger ſtature, than any other child uſeth to be; and that he began not to grow to that monſtrous bigneſs, untill he was ſix months old; and that he had loſt much of his fleſh ſince he was weaned, which had been done only fourteen dayes before.</item>

                        <item> 14. The weight of his body (which could not be meaſured, becauſe of the want of <hi>weights</hi>) is ſo great, that he is thereby rendered ſo lazie, that a <hi>Girl</hi> of twelve or thirteen years old muſt carry him from place to place, his arms being about her

But ſuch would know, that I ever had a great eſtimation of all, who have written ſoberly (as all have done, that ever I ſaw, Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> excepted) and to demonſtrat the truth of this, to the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous of that <hi>crue,</hi> I have done the like my ſelf; being confident, that what ever hath been written in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> will tend to the honour of the <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Artiſts;</hi> becauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to the beſt uſe, by perſons of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And when ſuch as are deſtitute of this director, do any harm, by preſumptuous meddling with ſuch writings, they, at leaſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59896:76"/>others, will be taught to make their addreſs unto thoſe who are the licenced and qualified profeſſors of the <hi>Art.</hi> 2. They will, no doubt, much reſent my writing againſt a <hi>dead Man,</hi> who is unable to anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo challenge me of baſeneſs. To this I anſwer, that it appeareth, Mr. <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peper,</hi> having <hi>aſtrologically</hi> foreſeen, that ſome would write againſt him after his death, did pen that <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> entituled <hi>Culpepers Ghoſt,</hi> generouſly to excuſe any that intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do it, and to excite others who inclined not to it; and that he might not come ſhort of them in the like work: For it is impoſsible to exult ſo much over him, after his death, as he doth in that <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> and others of his writings, over others, who were gone hence before his own birth. Others will poſsibly condemn my noticeing and anſwering ſuch ſcurrilous, profane and unchriſtian expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as are found in his writings, and which no ſober or wiſe man will care-for. To theſe I anſwer, that though it be impoſsible, that he, by being <hi>anſwered according to his folly,</hi> can be rendered capable of being impeded from <hi>becoming wiſe in his own conceit,</hi> yet ſuch as ſurvive him, and are daily, in his
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59896:76"/>name, printing <hi>books,</hi> ſtuffed with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions, as were familiar unto him, may be taught this leſſon.</p>
                  <p>It ought to be the lamentation of all, who have any knowledge of the myſterious opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſagacious <hi>Nature,</hi> that there are ſo few who make it their ſtudy, to diſcover more of her myſteries; and that ſuch as have made ſome progreſs in this work, are ſo ſparing in communicating their knowledge unto others, eſpecially in this <hi>age,</hi> wherein there are ſo many, who (as Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> ever did) offer nothing to the moſt delicat pallats, but <hi>cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be recocta,</hi> that is <hi>ov'r-nights Keal.</hi> It is moſt probable, that if Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> had been ſo far favoured by the <hi>heavenly powers,</hi> as to have been made the firſt diſcoverer of the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the blood</hi> (as was the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and famous Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi>) he would have made <hi>Aurum Potabile</hi> of it, that is, written of it to no purpoſe.

                  <p>Moreover, the pious and learned <hi>Interpreters,</hi> being moſt zealous to advance the knowledge of God and of the Scriptures, did, upon the margents of many <hi>Bibles,</hi> ſet down the interpretations of the moſt part of the proper names.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add, that Mr. <hi>Culpeper,</hi> his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe Chapters in the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of no leſs preſumptuous impiety, than, firſt, the taxing of Almighty God, His Wiſdom and Will, in not authorizing the holy Pen-men of the Scriptures to explicat all the proper names, as they did the moſt conſiderable. Secondly, that he would have had the <hi>Interpreters</hi> to have added unto the Scriptures, the explications of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names, which are not explicat in the original text; by doing of which, they ſhould have made themſelves the object of that dreadfull threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.18.</p>
                  <p>As for that expreſſion of his, <hi>Whole ſentences in Scripture are ſo tranſlated, that it would make a man ſick to ſee them,</hi> I ſhall only ſay this of it, that no ingenuous and rational man, would have ſo impudently aſſerted ſo great a paradox and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, without inſtancing ſome particular ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for proving of his aſſertion. It is one of Mr. <hi>Culpeper,</hi> his own phyſical ſentences, that <hi>phyſick without a reaſon, is like a pudding without fat;</hi> the like whereof may very well be ſaid of this his
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59896:80"/>extravagant aſſertion, deſtitute of probation.</p>
                  <p>It is admirable, that Mr. <hi>Culpeper,</hi> who (in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> prefixed to his <hi>Tranſlation of the London Diſpenſatory</hi>) aſſumeth unto himſelf, <hi>fellowſhip with Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and likeneſs to God,</hi> did not take the pains to tranſlate, or correct ſome of thoſe Scriptures which he reprehended. But his ſurviving wife (in her <hi>Epiſtle</hi> prefixed to his <hi>Treatiſe of Aurum potabile</hi>) ſeemeth to give a ſufficient reaſon for this omiſſion, in theſe words, <hi>My husband left ſeventy nine books, of his own making or tranſlating, in my hands—Alſo my Husband left ſeventeen books, compleatly perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the hands of Mr.</hi> Cole, <hi>for which he payed my Husband in his life-time.</hi> Let the ſober and judicious <hi>Reader</hi> judge of the probability of this, conſidering that he had not above nine years for this work and his <hi>aſtrological</hi> ſtudies alſo (for he began not to write till the year, 1648. or 1649. and he died, 1654. or 1655.) and whether or not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny books have been printed in his name, ſince his death, which were not written ſome years after the ſame; particularly that book, entituled, <hi>Arts Maſter-piece; or the beautifying part of phyſick; whereby all defects of nature in both ſexes are amended, age renewed, youth continued, and all imperfections fairly remedied—Never before extant, though long ſince promiſed by Mr.</hi> Nic.

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:59896:82"/>&amp;c. Let the judicious Readers, who have any knowledge of the Scriptures, conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not that Propheſie was penned only, or at all, in relation to the writings of theſe <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,</hi> (as his words do clearly import) eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſeing the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> applyeth them more (yea only) ſpiritually, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.25,26,27.</p>

                  <p>I will now inquire, if Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> had any knowledge or eſtimation of the moſt excellent Art, <hi>Chymiſtrie.</hi> Surely the vulgars will cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me, as moſt ridiculouſly uncharitable, in doubting of either; ſeing he hath written (as they ſay) a moſt learned <hi>Treatiſe of Aurum Potabile,</hi> and <hi>Chymical Inſtitutions,</hi> in his <hi>School of phyſick,</hi> printed, <hi>anno.</hi> 1659. For determining of this controverſie, I will only propoſe ſome <hi>Querees,</hi> according to which the judicious <hi>Reader</hi> may conclude as he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Quer.</hi> 1. Is it probable, that if Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> had underſtood any thing of the art called <hi>Chymic,</hi> in <hi>anno.</hi> 1648. or 1649. (at which time he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59896:85"/>to write) would he not have manifeſted ſome what of it in his <hi>Tranſlation of the London Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſatory,</hi> when he came to the <hi>Chymical</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions (ſeing he did cenſure many of their other preſcriptions, as informal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and not have tranſlated them <hi>verbatim,</hi> without any anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adverſions; neither, at the beginning (when writing of the <hi>Oyl of Worm-wood</hi>) have given this advice? <hi>Your beſt way to learn to Still Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Oyls, is to learn at an Alchymiſt: for I reſt conſident, the greateſt part of the Colledge had no more skill in Chymiſtrie, than I have in building houſes.</hi>

                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>Quer.</hi> 2. If he had underſtood this ingenious and uſefull art, would he have, in the cloſe of his dayes (when he penned his <hi>Ghoſt</hi>) given it ſuch a ſlender and detracting commendatory teſtimony, as he did page fifth and ſixth, in theſe words. <hi>And as for Chymiſtric, of which I had a mighty high opinion in my life-time, I muſt confeſs, though I ſtill acknowledge the Art to be very inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and uſefull to ſearch into the myſteries of nature, and the beſt key of natural Philoſophy, and that by help thereof, ſome very uſefull medicaments are daily made, as my</hi> Aurum Potabile, <hi>of which I left a Treatiſe, yet I do do now much doubt, whether a general ſupply of medicaments, for all caſes obvious in practice, can by Chymiſtrie be afforded, better than the often approved, and by experience confirmed, Galeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59896:85"/>and a Hippocratical remedies?</hi> It is too too evident, that if he had not left that <hi>Treatiſe of Aurum Potabile,</hi> (which is the only uſefull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament which he acknowledgeth to be made by <hi>Chymiſtric</hi>) to have been publiſhed in his own name, the moſt excellent Art, would not have been ſo favourably mentioned.</p>

If Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> had been it ſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the principles of this art, as would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemed one, in whoſe name <hi>Chymical Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>a Treatiſe of Aurum Potabile,</hi> were to be publiſhed, would he have, in thoſe <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> begun with, and (for the moſt part) proceeded in the practical part of the art, and that only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it had been written of by others, above twenty times, before he ſaw the light of the <hi>Sun?</hi> Surely, when he penned thoſe <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> he did forget, that the learned <hi>Sennertus,</hi> and all others who ever wrote <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> to any Art, did confine themſelves unto the <hi>the cretical part,</hi> deſcribing only the neceſſary <hi>pracognita,</hi> before the <hi>practical</hi> ſhould be attempted.</p>
                  <p>I will here give you a taſte of his great skill in this Art, by mentioning ſome of his expreſſions in the ninth Chapter of thoſe <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> where writing <hi>of the Quinteſſence of every ſimple mater;</hi> he deſcribeth it thus, <hi>Quinteſſence is the fifth part of every thing having form and ſubſtance, and a moſt ſubtile ſpirit drawn from its body,</hi> &amp;c. And a little after, <hi>Quinteſſence—ſolely by its ſelf, hath none of the four qualities in it,</hi> viz.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59896:86"/>
                     <hi>watry, airy, firy or earthly, which could be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned or diſcovered, by the judicious inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt skilfull Philoſophers.—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for a concluſion obſerve, that it is neither hot nor cold, nor moiſt nor dry, but is a thing of a temperate nature, exceeding all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are under heaven.</hi> Then he affirmeth, that <hi>it is chiefly to be underſtood of Wine,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> whereof he calleth the <hi>Quinteſſence,</hi> and ſheweth the vulgar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of deſtilling it, <hi>chap.</hi> 10 and biddeth <hi>lute the veſſels, that the animal and vegetable Virtue may not exhale out of the Wine.</hi> Is it not admirable, that Mr. <hi>Culpeper, (upon whoſe Diet, Schooling and being at the Univerſity of</hi> Cambridge, <hi>four hundred pounds were ſpent,</hi> as is affirmed by that moſt adulatory Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his <hi>life,</hi> prefixed to his <hi>School of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> ſhould affirm ſuch paradoxes, and never give one reaſon (wiſe or fooliſh) for proving of any of them.

When he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know what kinds of Oyls, there being Oyls of different natures and operations, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>Any Oyls, becauſe I intend to try con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſickly <hi>Ruſtick</hi> came unto her, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a pain in his neck, and betwixt his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. She affirmed his diſeaſe to be <hi>the Ripples in his neck,</hi> and eſſayed to cure him thus; every morning he got a good draught of warm <hi>Ale,</hi> with ſome <hi>Ginger;</hi> and ſo ſoon as he had drunk that, ſhe put him into the <hi>Barn</hi> to threſh a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ſtack</hi> of her own. Thus continued he under <hi>phyſick</hi> till the ſtack was threſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59896:89"/>A <hi>Ruſtick</hi> woman came unto her, to get her advice concerning the <hi>Gravell,</hi> wherewith ſhe was much troubled. The <hi>Doctrix</hi> gave her this advice, for cauſing the ſtone fall down into the neck of the bladder, <hi>You muſt ſtand leaning forwards with your two hands, upon the arms of a great chair, ſetting your feet far aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; then let your Husband take a broad ſhovel, and give you four or five good clanks or ſtrokes upon the buttocks with it.</hi> In my own audience ſhe confeſſed this ſtory to be true, unto ſeveral conſiderable perſons.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A valetudinary Ruſtick came unto her, and deſired ſome things for his health; to whom (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome diſcourſe, and ſtedfaſt looking into his countenance) ſhe gave this anſwer, <hi>truly friend you will die.</hi> The perſon then (with a more melancholy aſpect demanded <hi>how ſhe did know that?</hi> But ſhe declined to give him a reaſon for her prognoſtick, affirming, <hi>that it was not for him to know that: For</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>it is ſufficient that I know it.</hi> At length, being further preſſed, ſhe told him, <hi>that he had drunk a fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The reaſon of this ridiculous expreſſion concerning the <hi>moon,</hi> is none other than this; ſhe having (to my certain knowledge) Mr. <hi>Culpepers Engliſh Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> or <hi>Herbal,</hi> hath read in it, <hi>that ſome herbs are herbs of the Moon, others herbs of the Sun, and others herbs of Mars,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and do cauſe ſuch and ſuch diſeaſes, and cure others;</hi> and having ſome rude and ignorant conceptions, concerning ſuch things, did utter that ridiculous prognoſtick and reaſon. It is not much to be admired, that a ſilly woman had ſuch ſhallow imaginations, ſeing the moſt learned and famous Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> was ſo preſumptuous, as to enſlave all <hi>vegetables</hi> to a neceſſary and unavoidable dependence, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the influences of the <hi>Stars,</hi> which were not created untill the fourth day of the <hi>creation,</hi> which was the day after the creation of <hi>vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables.</hi> The conſideration of which, made the truly moſt learned and pious Dr. <hi>Thomas Fuller</hi> (in his 18. <hi>Scripture obſervation,</hi> in his book, entituled, <hi>Good thoughts in bad times</hi>) reſolve, <hi>hereafter to admire God more, and fear Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers leſs.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the <hi>Title-page</hi> alſo, he promiſeth <hi>to ſhew the time of gathering all herbs, both vulgarly and aſtrologically;</hi> but when he cometh to treat <hi>of gathering roots</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 382. <hi>and</hi> 383) he only controverteth a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>deſcending of the ſap to the root in Autumn, and its aſcending in the Spring,</hi> and laughs at it as a <hi>tradition.</hi> At length, he determineth the controverſie thus, <hi>The truth is, when the Sun declines from the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59896:91"/>of Cancer, the ſap begins to congeal both in root and branch; when it toucheth the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick of Capricorn, and aſcendeth to us ward it begins to wax thin again, and by degrees, as it congealed.</hi> This is an aſſertion of Mr. <hi>Culpepers,</hi> which he wrote, <hi>after that he had conſulted</hi> (as he writeth in his <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader</hi>) <hi>with his two brothers, Dr. Reaſon and Dr. Experience, and that after his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age taken to viſit his mother Nature.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe after his aſſerting, <hi>that neither</hi> Gerard <hi>nor</hi> Perkinſon, <hi>nor any that ever wrote in the like nature, gave ever one wiſe reaſon for what they wrote, but trained up young novices in the ſchool of Tradition, and did teach them, juſt as a Parrot is taught to ſpeak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this aſſertion of Mr. <hi>Culpepers,</hi> it is moſt evident, that he hath been of opinion, 1. that the natural withering of herbs in autumn, whilſt they are not cut down, proceeds only from the congealing of their ſap: becauſe of the Suns de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination from the <hi>Tropick of Cancer.</hi> The aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he learned from Dr. <hi>Tradition,</hi> and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Dr. <hi>Reaſon</hi> inferred from it this opinion; to which I oppoſe this, as ſavouring of more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon, and leſs reaſonleſs <hi>tradition.</hi> The root of the herb, having in the <hi>Summer</hi>-time, furniſhed the ſtems, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with vegetative ſpirits, which it conveyeth by the aqueous humidity,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59896:91"/>theſe ſpirits being diſtributed amongſt the leaves, flowers and ſeeds, provident <hi>nature</hi> appointeth the evaporation or exhalation of the ſame, by the <hi>Suns</hi> heat, as an enemy to their conſervation, and a great accelerator of their putrefaction. 2. He hath thought, that the ſap of the roots of herbs, is not ſo thin in the middle of winter (when the earth, about them, is moſt ſucculent or wet) as in the middle of ſummer, when the ground is not half ſo wet. But if he had required the judgment of Dr. <hi>Reaſon</hi> concerning this affair, he would have told him, that the vegetative ſoul, remaining in the root, doth, in the winter time, attract more ſap to it, than it had at the end of autumn, for nouriſhing and ſtrengthening it, the better to reſiſt the brumal cold, which would be ready to kill it, after the loſs of ſo many ſpirits, as it hath communicated unto the ſeeds, and other parts, which it ſent forth in the Summer and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, and after the great cold is gone, it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to operat upon that ſap, ſending it forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new leaves, ſtems, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which it alimenteth afterwards with new ſap, which it attracteth from the ambient earth.</p>
                  <p>Hence it appeareth, that the moſt convenient ſeaſon for collecting of roots, is the Spring-time, immediatly before they put forth new leaves or ſtems. And I am confident, that Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> never eated <hi>Parſneeps,</hi> but in winter, though he did it not for this reaſon. Let the judicious <hi>Reader</hi> conſider, if this be not a very clear hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59896:92"/>at the reaſon of that aſſertion of Mr. <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pepers</hi> (chap. 1. <hi>of leaves of herbs or trees</hi>) which he (who wrote as before, in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi>) doth moſt impudently ſet down, without any reaſon, ſubjoyned unto it, in theſe words. <hi>The leaves of ſuch herbs as run up to ſeed, are not ſo good when they are in ſlower as before, ſome few excepted, the leaves of which are ſeldom or never uſed.</hi> But here Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> ſeemeth to anſwer for ſuch omiſſions, in that learned and compleat <hi>Method of Phyſick,</hi> by theſe words, concerning the book, in his <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader; In mine, if you view it with the eye of reaſon, you ſhall ſee a reaſon for every thing that is written.</hi> But theſe words, do rather pre-require more reaſon in the <hi>Reader,</hi> than is in the book.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place take notice, how he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth this his book. You read before, that in the <hi>Title-page</hi> he calleth it <hi>A compleat method of phyſick;</hi> and in the <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader,</hi> he writeth thus; <hi>The proſit and benefits ariſing from it, or that may accreu unto a wiſe man from it, are many; ſo many, that ſhould I ſum up all the particulars, the Epiſtle would be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the third place take notice, that though Mr. <hi>Culpeper,</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader,</hi> did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>Gerard, Perkinſon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for never giving one wiſe reaſon for what they wrote,</hi> &amp;c. yet all along through the book, he doth moſt confidently take upon him <hi>to determine the degrees of heat and coldneſs, or drineſs and moiſtneſs of herbs,</hi> according as did the moſt fabulous writers, who were the firſt authors of ſuch like <hi>traditions.</hi> Take this one inſtance, as the moſt conſiderable (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a part of that diſcourſe, which in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> he calleth <hi>the Key of the whole book</hi>) which ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59896:93"/>of moſt preſumptuous conſidence, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs tradition; and it is concerning <hi>Worm-wood,</hi> of which he writeth thus, <hi>it is hot and dry in the firſt degree,</hi> viz. <hi>juſt as hot as your blood, and no hotter.</hi> Should ſuch a <hi>Critick</hi> have ſo perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily aſſerted, without giving any reaſon for it? at leaſt, ſhould he not have prefixed to his book a rational rule for diſcovering the temperaments of herbs in general, ſeing all others who wrote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, concerning herbs, did aſſert the like, and never gave the leaſt ſhadow of reaſon for it. Surely he had a good opportunity for the doing of this, in his <hi>Key to Galens method of phyſick,</hi> (ſubjoyned to his <hi>Tranſlation of the</hi> London <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſatory</hi>) <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. where he writeth <hi>of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of Medicines in general,</hi> and where he hath a diſcourſe, not exceeding eight lines in 8<hi rend="sup">vo</hi>, neither aſſording two grains of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Reader.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, let the judicious <hi>Reader</hi> conſider what he hath written at large concerning <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> (which diſcourſe, he called <hi>the Key of the whole book;</hi> and in the cloſe of it, he calleth it <hi>a Jewel, more worth than a Diamond;</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth, that <hi>in the words of it, lies a Key which will unlock the cabinet of Phyſick</hi>) for (as Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> wrote concerning ſome places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi>) <hi>It would make a man ſick to ſee it, being a diſcourſe ſtuffed with variety of moſt ridiculous impertinencies;</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly where he ſaith, that <hi>where Dr. Reaſon

                  </p>
                  <p>You muſt excuſe my not meddling with any thing in his writings which is <hi>aſtrological:</hi> For I acknowledge my ſelf not to be ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the principles of that Art, and therefore do refer him unto others. Only I will ſay this, that if his <hi>Aſtrology in Medicinals</hi> be no better than it (and the <hi>Aſtrology</hi> of others more famous than he) was in <hi>Politicks,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> (when <hi>Monarchy</hi> was ſaid to be eternally exiled from <hi>Great Britain,</hi> by all the powers of the heavens) they will miſ-ſpend their time, who will take the pains to read.</p>
                  <p>Concerning his great skill in the <hi>Pharmacopoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical art,</hi> which he endeavoureth to manifeſt in his <hi>Tranſlation of the</hi> London <hi>Diſpenſatory,</hi> and Chapters ſubjoyned unto his <hi>Engliſh Phyſician,</hi> I will only ſay this, that whoſoever ſhall compare thoſe his writings, with the ingenious and learned <hi>Animadverſions of Dr.</hi> John Zuelfer, upon the <hi>Auguſtan Diſpenſatory,</hi> will be ſoon convinced, that an <hi>Apprentice</hi> of one years ſtanding would have written as well, if not better than he did.</p>
                  <p>Take now a demonſtration of his matchleſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence; which is this, in his <hi>Tranſlation of the</hi> London <hi>Diſpenſatory,</hi> when he deſcribeth the virtues of the <hi>Vinegar of Squills,</hi> prefixing his own name to them, he doth it, according to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> his words, which he had ſtollen, either out of

                     <hi>Galens</hi> own works, or elſe from the <hi>Auguſtan Diſpenſatory.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding of this, he had ſo much impudent confidence, as (a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) to challenge the learned <hi>Phyſicians</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> for ſtealing the preſcript of the <hi>Lochoch of Purſlain,</hi> from <hi>Auſberg;</hi> and then addeth theſe ridiculous and ſcurrilous words, <hi>you ſhall ſhortly hear the Auguſtan Phyſicians come, with how and cry after the Colledge, and cry, ſtop theeves.</hi> Let others remember this <hi>proverb,</hi> which he forgot.

                  <p>Before I conclude, I will acquaint you with this true ſtory: An able <hi>Phyſician</hi> of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being demanded, by one of Mr. <hi>Culpepers</hi> diſciples if he had read any of Mr. <hi>Culpepers</hi> works? anſwered, <hi>I tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k God, I never had ſo much leiſure as to do it.</hi> It having been my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to have ſome leiſure, for that end, I have given you a taſte only, of what I found in ſuch of his writings, as <hi>providence</hi> did throw into my hands. And all that ever I learned from them is this, which I look upon as the <hi>Corollary</hi> of this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Culpepers</hi> writings, are only either other mens writings which he hath tranſlated into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, or collections out of other mens works, which he hath deformed with malicious, ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, detracting and railing expreſſions, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59896:94"/>to beautifie with ſome ridiculous, and (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) impertinent jeſts.</p>
                  <p>So that that ſentence (which you will find in the <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader,</hi> prefixed to his <hi>Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the</hi> London <hi>Diſpenſatory</hi>) may be moſt pertinently applyed unto himſelf, <hi>mutatis mutan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis; A Phyſician riding</hi> (paſſing) <hi>in Pluſh</hi> (Print) <hi>and not one grain of wit, more than was printed before he was born.</hi> By theſe words he doth well condemn thoſe, who reſt ſatisfied with what is already diſcovered and known unto all, and preſs not forward unto new diſcoveries, which ought to be the only exerciſe of the <hi>Scholars</hi> (eſpecially <hi>Phyſicians</hi>) of our age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is abundance of moſt excellent books already publiſhed, concerning all ſubjects; and yet there was never a ſcribler in the world, which made the <hi>Preſs</hi> ruminat more, to little or no purpoſe, than he did.</p>
                  <p>For a concluſion to this diſcourſe, I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer one great objection, wherewith I will, very probably, be troubled hereafter; which is this, ſince Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> his death, his relict, Mrs. <hi>Alice Culpeper,</hi> hath in print, by way of <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> renounced many books of her Husbands, printed in his life-time, one whereof, called <hi>Culpepers laſt Legacy,</hi> &amp;c, ſhe denieth to have been written by him: <hi>becauſe it is not written according to her Husbands lofty and maſculine ſtile—and in ſuch a ſolemn valediction, he could not, poſſibly, have forgot his wonted reſpects to the Colledge</hi>
